# Performance Budgets

Baseline performance targets for mcp-agent-mail Rust port.
Updated via native `am bench` and `cargo bench`.

## Optimization Workflow

1. **Profile** — measure before changing anything
2. **Change** — apply one optimization
3. **Prove** — verify behavior unchanged (golden outputs) AND performance improved

## Hardware + Environment Baseline

All archive-write numbers below are tied to the reference host and should not be
treated as portable absolutes.

- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 5995WX, 64 cores / 128 threads, boost enabled, `performance` governor (`413-4575 MHz` reported by `lscpu`)
- **RAM**: `499 GiB` system memory, `63 GiB` swap
- **Storage**: workspace on `/data` -> `/dev/nvme0n1`, Samsung SSD 9100 PRO 4TB NVMe, `btrfs`, mount options `rw,noatime,compress=zstd:1,ssd,discard=async,space_cache=v2,subvolid=5,subvol=/`
- **OS**: Ubuntu 25.10 (Questing Quokka), kernel `6.17.0-19-generic`
- **Rust toolchain**: `rust-toolchain.toml` pins `nightly`; reference compiler was `rustc 1.97.0-nightly (e9e32aca5 2026-04-17)`
- **Build profile**: `cargo bench` with `[profile.bench] inherits = "release"`; effective settings are `opt-level=3`, `lto="thin"`, `codegen-units=1`, `panic="abort"`, `strip="symbols"`
- **Workload isolation**: bare host, no taskset/cgroup pinning, remote execution via `rch exec`, target dir currently `/tmp/cargo-target`
- **Runtime**: wall-clock Criterion measurement; warm-path side-artifacts are enabled with `MCP_AGENT_MAIL_ARCHIVE_PROFILE=1`
- **Canonical wrapper**: `scripts/bench_baseline.sh`
- **Latest successful cold-harness bundle**: `tests/artifacts/bench/archive/1776505951_367469/summary.json`
- **Latest warm-path profile artifacts**: `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_batch_100_profile.md`, `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_batch_scaling.csv`, `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_batch_100_spans.json`
- **Latest dated supplement copies**: `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_batch_100_flamegraph_2026-04-18.svg`, `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_batch_scaling_2026-04-18.csv`, `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_batch_100_spans_2026-04-18.json`

### Re-running the archive baseline

Use the canonical wrapper:

```bash
scripts/bench_baseline.sh
```

If the shared checkout is temporarily non-buildable, create a clean detached
worktree at the desired source commit and point the wrapper at it:

```bash
scripts/bench_baseline.sh --bench-root /abs/path/to/clean/worktree
```

The wrapper:

1. Captures the hardware + environment fingerprint
2. Runs `MCP_AGENT_MAIL_ARCHIVE_PROFILE=1 rch exec -- cargo bench -p mcp-agent-mail --bench benchmarks -- archive_write_batch`
3. Copies the `archive_batch_*` raw artifacts into `tests/artifacts/bench/archive_baseline/<run_id>/`
4. Emits `fingerprint.json` and `summary.json` for machine diffing / future perf-gate ingestion

Artifact supplement note (`br-8qdh0.10`):
- the warm-path profile contract now requires six scaling points (`1/10/50/100/500/1000`), Chrome-trace-compatible span JSON (`traceEvents`), and explicit `perf.profile.*` structured logging fields for reruns

Current blocker on `2026-04-18`:
- fresh reruns from the shared checkout and clean detached worktrees at `f19dd828`, `1d83c6b7`, and `99bc2663` all fail before measurement because `mcp-agent-mail-server` expects `metrics::AtcMetricsSnapshot` / `global_metrics().atc`
- until that compile break is fixed, treat `tests/artifacts/bench/archive/1776505951_367469/summary.json` as the authoritative measured baseline and use new `archive_baseline/<run_id>/summary.json` bundles as blocker artifacts, not as latency evidence

### Variance Envelope

- Treat `batch-100 p95 ~= 238.1ms` on the same CPU/storage/filesystem/kernel/governor as the reference steady-state target.
- Treat `<= 10%` p95 drift on the same host as noise.
- Investigate `> 10%` drift; escalate at `>= 20%` or after three consecutive `> 10%` runs.
- Cross-host comparisons are advisory only; NVMe model, filesystem, mount options, and kernel materially affect `fsync`-heavy workloads.
- If a same-host rerun breaches the envelope after an archive-path change, follow [docs/OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md](/data/projects/mcp_agent_mail_rust/docs/OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md#emergency-roll-back-archive-batch-write-optimization).

### Cross-Filesystem Fsync Matrix (br-8qdh0.11)

Cross-filesystem archive verification is driven by:

- `crates/mcp-agent-mail-storage/tests/fsync_matrix.rs`
- `scripts/bench_archive_fsync_matrix.sh`
- `.github/workflows/archive-fsync-matrix.yml`

The probe records:

1. single-message write latency (`p50`/`p95`/`p99`)
2. batch-100 write latency (`p50`/`p95`/`p99`)
3. a crash-after-`flush_async_commits()` durability check that reopens the archive after a forced child-process kill

CI-covered budgets:

| Filesystem | CI coverage | fsync mode | Single p95 | Batch-100 p95 | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|---------------|-------|
| ext4 (`data=ordered`) | Linux loopback | `normal` | < 25ms | < 250ms | Baseline Linux recommendation |
| ext4 (`data=journal`) | Linux loopback | `normal` | < 40ms | < 350ms | Higher journal cost; use when durability policy is stricter than latency policy |
| xfs | Linux loopback | `normal` | < 25ms | < 250ms | Recommended for low-variance Linux server writes |
| btrfs | Linux loopback | `normal` | < 50ms | < 500ms | Supported but slower under CoW + metadata pressure |
| APFS | macOS runner | `barrier_only` | < 35ms | < 300ms | Durable rename + barrier semantics differ from Linux flush semantics |
| tmpfs | Linux tmpfs | `buffered` | < 15ms | < 150ms | Canary only; not durable and still pays Git/process overhead, so treat it as a logic floor rather than a near-zero write budget |

Documented but not yet CI-gated:

| Filesystem | Current stance | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| NTFS / WSL | Manual spot-check only | Use for portability evidence, not for release gating yet |
| ZFS | Unsupported initially | Add only when a stable runner or dedicated lab host exists |

Operator rules of thumb:

- Use ext4 (`data=ordered`) or xfs when archive write latency is the deciding constraint.
- Treat btrfs as supported-but-slower; compare against the btrfs row above instead of the ext4 baseline.
- Treat tmpfs results as a logic/CPU canary only. A tmpfs pass does **not** say anything about crash durability.
- If only one filesystem regresses, use the per-FS artifact bundle from the workflow before widening the global budget or rolling back the whole archive-path change.

### Era note (2026-08-18): the 2026-02 operational baselines do not reproduce on current gate hardware — and it is NOT an engine regression

A same-host A/B settled this during the v0.3.28 release gating: the v0.3.27
tree (pre-registry fsqlite engine, rebuilt from the preserved 0.3.27 release
buildroot) and current main (registry fsqlite 0.3.4), run back-to-back on the
same idle 64-core host, produce statistically identical results — `am mail
send` ~336ms and `am mail inbox` ~2.8s under both engines (vs the 27ms/11.5ms
recorded above), and the 30-agent DB+Git pipeline at p99 ≈ 38–47s under both
(fully correct, 150/150, 0 errors). The four latency-budget stress suites that
assume the older numbers (`p99 < 10s` pipeline plus the three 240s-watchdog
suites) are therefore red on this host for *environment-era* reasons, and they
are deliberately left unmasked pending a conscious per-host budget
recalibration — do not "fix" them by hunting for an engine regression (that
attribution was made twice during gating and retracted twice; see the
FrankenSQLite tracker bd-pr6ii retraction). When recalibrating, capture fresh
`am bench --quick` numbers on the target host with an isolated
`AGENT_MAIL_HOME`/`AGENT_MAIL_DB` (measurements against a live shared mailbox
absorb daemon contention and are not comparable to these seeded-fixture
baselines).

## ATC Hot-Path Guard (br-bn0vb.15)

The ATC send-message guard is enforced by:

- `.github/workflows/atc-perf-gate.yml`
- `scripts/bench_atc_perf_gate.sh`
- `benches/atc_perf_baseline.json`
- `docs/ATC_PERF_BUDGETS.md`

The workflow runs `am bench` against the dedicated ATC-mode `mail_send`
variants and enforces that `shadow` and `live` stay within `5%` p95 overhead of
`mail_send_no_atc`.

The checked-in absolute baseline is retained for historical context in the PR
artifacts, but the gate only fails when the relative ATC overhead budget is
breached. Absolute drift on a different or noisier host is reported as an
advisory note, not a hard failure.

Initial checked-in capture (`2026-04-18`):

| Benchmark | Baseline p95 | Mean | p99 | Delta vs no_atc | Allowed p95 |
|-----------|--------------|------|-----|-----------------|-------------|
| `mail_send_no_atc` | `205.78ms` | `189.28ms` | `213.61ms` | `+0.00%` | `205.78ms` |
| `mail_send_atc_shadow` | `206.13ms` | `200.13ms` | `286.77ms` | `+0.17%` | `216.07ms` |
| `mail_send_atc_live` | `214.05ms` | `197.38ms` | `291.76ms` | `+4.02%` | `216.07ms` |

Historical seed artifact:
- `tests/artifacts/perf/atc_pre_wiring_baseline.json`

## Archive Write Budgets

Baseline numbers are taken from the bench harness artifacts emitted by:

```bash
rch exec -- cargo bench -p mcp-agent-mail --bench benchmarks -- archive_write
```

Artifacts (JSON + raw samples) are written under:
- `tests/artifacts/bench/archive/<run_id>/summary.json`

Most recent cold-harness baseline run (2026-04-18):
`tests/artifacts/bench/archive/1776505951_367469/summary.json`.

Historical pre-profile reference (2026-02-08):
`tests/artifacts/bench/archive/1770542015_450923/summary.json`.

Golden baseline: `tests/artifacts/bench/baseline/golden_baseline_20260208.json`.

Budgets are set to ~2x the measured baseline p95 to absorb variance.

| Operation | Baseline p50 | Baseline p95 | Baseline p99 | Budget p95 | Budget p99 | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|------------|-------|

### Warm-Path Profile Update (br-8qdh0.3, 2026-04-18)

Historical pre-fix analysis is preserved in:
- `docs/PERF-archive-batch-profile-2026-04-18.md`

Current post-fix artifacts:
- `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_batch_100_spans.json`
- `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_batch_scaling.csv`
- `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_batch_100_flamegraph.svg`
- `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_batch_100_profile.md`
- `tests/artifacts/perf/extended_dimensions_2026-04-18.json`
- `benches/archive_perf_baseline.json` (checked-in CI gate baseline for warm batch-1/10/100)
- `.github/workflows/archive-perf-gate.yml` + `scripts/bench_archive_perf_gate.sh` (PR/scheduled regression gate)

Warm steady-state burst measurements (`MCP_AGENT_MAIL_ARCHIVE_PROFILE=1 rch exec -- cargo bench ... archive_write_batch`):

| Scenario | p50 | p95 | p99 | p99.9 | p99.99 | Note |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-------|--------|------|
| batch-1 | ~11.7ms | ~12.4ms | ~13.5ms | ~13.5ms | ~13.5ms | Current sample count is 40, so p99.9/p99.99 collapse to the worst observed sample |
| batch-10 | ~28.8ms | ~31.8ms | ~32.7ms | ~32.7ms | ~32.7ms | Current sample count is 25, so p99.9/p99.99 collapse to the worst observed sample |
| batch-100 | ~213.5ms | ~238.1ms | ~241.8ms | ~241.8ms | ~241.8ms | Under the `<250ms` p95 budget with ~`11.9ms` headroom; current sample count is 12, so tail sentinels equal the worst observed sample |

Scaling-law observation:
- `batch-100 p95 / batch-1 p95 = 19.27x`, so the per-message cost at batch-100 is ~`0.193x` batch-1.
- `wbq_flush` remains negligible; the decisive cost is now the batch archive write plus `flush_async_commits`.

CI perf gate policy:
- The archive regression gate compares warm batch-1/10/100 `p95` and `p99` against `benches/archive_perf_baseline.json`.
- The gate also records warm-tail sentinels (`p99.9`, `p99.99`, worst observed), direct `am serve-http` cold-start latency, and direct `am serve-http` peak RSS in a single extended-dimensions report.
- The gate allows a `10%` tolerance band over the stored `p95`/`p99` baselines to absorb runner noise, but still records hard budget breaches (`>250ms p95`, `>300ms p99`) separately.
- Tail regressions use a stricter guard: fail if `p99.9` regresses more than `50%` versus baseline or rises above `5x` the scenario `budget_p95`.
- Cold-start guard: `am serve-http --no-auth --no-tui` direct probe must stay at or below the stored `285ms` allowed band, with a hard budget of `<500ms`.
- Peak-memory guard: the same direct probe must stay at or below the stored `90MiB` allowed band, with a hard budget of `<128MiB`.
- PRs can carry the `perf-regression-acknowledged` label for an intentional, reviewed performance tradeoff; runtime/benchmark failures are never auto-acknowledged.

Span roll-up for warm batch-100:
- `archive_batch.write_message_batch` / `archive_batch.write_message_batch_bundle`: ~1.75s cumulative across 12 samples (~68% of sampled wall time)
- `archive_batch.flush_async_commits`: ~0.82s cumulative (~32%)
- `archive_batch.wbq_flush`: ~601us cumulative (noise floor)

### Archive Read Characterization (br-8qdh0.13, 2026-04-18)

Archive read-path characterization now lives in
`crates/mcp-agent-mail/benches/benchmarks.rs` under the `archive_read` group.
The deterministic warm summary artifact is written to:

- `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_read_summary.json`
- `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_read_summary_2026-04-18.json`

Reference run command:

```bash
MCP_AGENT_MAIL_BENCH_SCOPE=archive_read \
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/mcp_agent_mail_rust/target \
cargo bench -p mcp-agent-mail --bench benchmarks -- archive_read --noplot
```

Measured warm-cache baselines from `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_read_summary_2026-04-18.json`:

| Scenario | Dataset | Reads/op | Baseline p50 | Baseline p95 | Baseline p99 | Budget p95 | Budget p99 | Notes |
|----------|---------|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|------------|-------|
| `batch_sequential` | 1000 canonical messages | 1000 | ~28.7ms | ~30.1ms | ~30.8ms | < 60ms | < 75ms | Full canonical archive sweep; bound is dominated by file open + frontmatter parse per message |
| `random_access` | 1000 canonical messages | 100 | ~2.6ms | ~3.0ms | ~3.5ms | < 10ms | < 15ms | Deterministic pseudo-random read plan over the same warm dataset |

Current execution note (`2026-04-18`):
- `rch exec` could not be used as the source of truth for this run because worker `ts2`
  compiled a divergent/broken `asupersync` mirror while the local checkout compiled cleanly.
  Until worker skew is corrected, use the checked-in local summary JSON as the authoritative
  read-path baseline.

### MCP Tool Handler Baselines (Criterion, 2026-02-08)

## Global Search Budgets (br-3vwi.2.3)

Deterministic harness implemented in `crates/mcp-agent-mail/benches/benchmarks.rs` under the
`global_search` bench group. It seeds synthetic mailboxes of increasing size and measures the
DB-level global search pipeline p50/p95/p99 latency via
`mcp_agent_mail_db::search_service::execute_search_simple()` (planner → SQL → row mapping) for a
fixed query (`needle`, `limit=20`).

Artifacts are written under:
- `tests/artifacts/bench/search/<run_id>/summary.json`

To enforce budgets (CI/robot mode):

```bash
MCP_AGENT_MAIL_BENCH_ENFORCE_BUDGETS=1 \
  cargo bench -p mcp-agent-mail --bench benchmarks -- global_search
```

Initial budgets (conservative; tighten after the first baseline run on CI-like hardware):

| Scenario | Messages | Budget p95 | Budget p99 |
|----------|----------|------------|------------|
| small | 1,000 | < 3ms | < 5ms |
| medium | 5,000 | < 15ms | < 25ms |
| large | 15,000 | < 50ms | < 80ms |

## Search V3 frankensearch lexical-tier budgets (br-2tnl.7.5)

Deterministic harness implemented in `crates/mcp-agent-mail-db/benches/search_v3_bench.rs`.
Seeds frankensearch indexes (Tantivy is the lexical backend inside frankensearch) with synthetic
documents and measures `TantivyBridge::search()` p50/p95/p99 for a fixed query (`needle`, `limit=20`).

Tantivy is the lexical backend inside frankensearch; semantic and hybrid fusion are controlled by the
`hybrid` feature.

Artifacts are written under:
- `tests/artifacts/bench/search_v3/<run_id>/summary.json`

Also includes:
- Index build throughput (docs/sec) at each corpus size
- Incremental add throughput (batch 1/10/100)
- Disk overhead per document (bytes)

To enforce budgets (CI/robot mode):

```bash
MCP_AGENT_MAIL_BENCH_ENFORCE_BUDGETS=1 \
  cargo bench -p mcp-agent-mail-db --bench search_v3_bench
```

Baseline (2026-02-18):

| Scenario | Messages | Baseline p50 | Baseline p95 | Baseline p99 | Budget p95 | Budget p99 | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|-------|
| small | 1,000 | ~382µs | ~531µs | ~706µs | < 1.5ms | < 3ms | 6x under budget |
| medium | 5,000 | ~622µs | ~800µs | ~1.1ms | < 5ms | < 10ms | Frankensearch lexical sub-ms even at 5K |
| large | 15,000 | ~679µs | ~805µs | ~1.0ms | < 15ms | < 25ms | 18x under budget; lexical path barely scales with corpus |

Index build throughput (baseline): 7.5K docs/sec (1K), 36K docs/sec (5K), 90K docs/sec (15K).
Disk overhead: ~89-107 bytes/doc (amortized).

### Criterion Bench Groups

| Group | Bench IDs | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| `tantivy_lexical_search` | `small/1000`, `medium/5000`, `large/15000` | Core latency at scale |
| `tantivy_query_selectivity` | `high_selectivity`, `medium_selectivity`, `low_selectivity`, `phrase_query` | Query diversity on 5K corpus |

| `tantivy_incremental_add` | `batch/1`, `batch/10`, `batch/100` | Incremental update on 5K corpus |

### Two-Tier Semantic Budgets

Covered by `crates/mcp-agent-mail-search-core/benches/two_tier_bench.rs` (requires `semantic` feature).
Micro-benchmarks for dot product, normalization, score blending, and index-level search at 100/1K/10K.

## Share/Export Pipeline Budgets

Baseline numbers are taken from the bench harness artifacts emitted by:

```bash
cargo bench -p mcp-agent-mail --bench benchmarks -- share_export

Most recent baseline run (2026-02-06): `tests/artifacts/bench/share/1770390636_3768966/summary.json`.

Budgets are set to ~2x the measured baseline p95/p99 to absorb variance.

### Scenario: `medium_mixed_attachments` (100 kept, 20 dropped)

| Stage | Baseline p50 | Baseline p95 | Baseline p99 | Budget p95 | Budget p99 | Notes |
|-------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|------------|-------|
| Total | ~1.80s | ~1.89s | ~1.92s | < 4.0s | < 4.5s | End-to-end snapshot+scope+scrub+finalize+bundle+zip |
| Snapshot | ~31ms | ~33ms | ~34ms | < 80ms | < 100ms | SQLite online backup |
| Scope | ~13ms | ~15ms | ~15ms | < 40ms | < 50ms | Project filter + deletes |
| Scrub | ~14ms | ~16ms | ~17ms | < 50ms | < 60ms | Token redaction + clears |
| Finalize | ~312ms | ~322ms | ~424ms | < 700ms | < 900ms | FTS + views + indexes + VACUUM |
| Bundle | ~1.29s | ~1.35s | ~1.37s | < 2.8s | < 3.0s | Attachments + viewer export + manifest/scaffold |
| Zip | ~134ms | ~146ms | ~152ms | < 350ms | < 400ms | Deflate (level 9) with fixed timestamps |

Output sizes (baseline):
- Output dir: ~8.0MB
- Output zip: ~0.84MB

### Scenario: `chunked_small_threshold` (forced chunking)

This scenario forces chunking by setting a small chunk threshold (128KiB) to exercise chunking overhead.

Baseline (2026-02-06): ~13 chunks; total p95 ~1.88s; zip p95 ~0.16s.

### Encryption

Age encryption (`share::encrypt_with_age`) depends on the external `age` CLI being installed.
The baseline run above did not include encryption timings (`age` not found).

## Flamegraph Profiles (2026-02-09)

Generated via `cargo flamegraph --root` with `CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=true`.

| Profile | File | Samples | Key Finding |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| Tool handlers | `docs/perf/flamegraphs/bench_tools.svg` | 45,056 | 65% kernel (btrfs fdatasync), syscall cancel dominates userspace |
| Archive writes | `docs/perf/flamegraphs/bench_archive.svg` | 44,948 | Same pattern — I/O bound, not CPU bound |
| Archive batch 100 (warm path, 2026-04-18) | `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_batch_100_flamegraph.svg` | 77,537 | Allocator churn plus `commit-coalesce`, `git`, `unlinkat`, and `fsync` dominate the targeted batch path; `wbq_flush` is not a hotspot |

**Interpretation**: Both profiles confirm the strace analysis below. The Rust userspace code is
highly optimized; the bottleneck is kernel-side I/O (btrfs journal sync via `fdatasync`).
Optimization effort should target reducing sync frequency (commit batching) rather than
CPU-side code changes.

**2026-04-18 targeted update**: the warm batch-100 flamegraph refines that earlier conclusion.
The path is still I/O-heavy, but the highest-signal user-space stacks are allocator churn
(`_int_malloc`, `realloc`, `free`) plus `commit-coalesce` / `git` cleanup work, with
`unlinkat`, `rename`, `readdir`, and `fsync` showing the filesystem side of the same burst.
Optimization effort should focus on reducing per-message archive/object churn and git cleanup
inside the batch burst before spending more time on `wbq_flush`.

## Syscall Profile (strace, 2026-02-08)

Collected via `strace -c -f` on `mcp_agent_mail_tools/health_check` benchmark (representative of all tool paths).

| Syscall | % Time | Seconds | Calls | Errors | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| futex | 86.30% | 461.5s | 83,318 | 28,753 | **Lock contention dominates** — mutex/condvar waits |
| sched_yield | 8.02% | 42.9s | 129,758 | — | Spinlock yielding under contention |
| fdatasync | 1.70% | 9.1s | 20,118 | — | SQLite WAL durability |
| read | 0.59% | 3.2s | 695,171 | 173 | File and DB reads |
| openat | 0.59% | 3.1s | 388,634 | 28,810 | 7.4% failure rate |
| readlink | 0.31% | 1.7s | 206,280 | 206,280 | **100% failure** — canonicalize on non-symlinks |
| access | 0.31% | 1.7s | 277,845 | 20,169 | 7.3% failure rate — existence checks |
| newfstatat | 0.27% | 1.4s | 206,847 | 90,832 | 44% failure rate |

**Key insight**: 94.3% of wall-clock time is lock contention (futex + sched_yield). The filesystem and DB I/O are relatively fast; the bottleneck is serialization between threads.

**Actionable**: Reducing `readlink` calls (canonicalize caching) would eliminate 206K syscalls per benchmark run with zero risk.
