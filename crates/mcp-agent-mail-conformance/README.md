# mcp-agent-mail-conformance

Rust-side conformance harnesses for MCP Agent Mail.

This crate keeps the live Rust router honest against the legacy Python reference where parity is intentional, and it records the remaining Rust-native gaps so drift is explicit instead of accidental.

## What lives here

- Behavior parity fixtures in `tests/conformance/fixtures/python_reference.json`
- Regeneration artifacts in `tests/conformance/fixtures/scenario_catalog.json` and `tests/conformance/fixtures/python_reference_regen_report.md`
- Rust-native golden fixtures in `tests/conformance/fixtures/rust_native/`
- Tool description parity against `../../tests/conformance/fixtures/tool_descriptions.json`
- Resource description drift guards for shared resource templates
- Focused regression checks for tool filtering, error envelopes, and outage behavior
- Automation entrypoints in `../../scripts/regen_python_parity_fixtures.sh` and `.github/workflows/conformance-fixture-regen.yml`

## Current coverage (as of 2026-08-23)

- The live Rust router exposes 43 tools.
- 37 tools have Python behavior fixtures in `tests/conformance/fixtures/python_reference.json`.
- 6 tools are Rust-native extensions: `resolve_pane_identity`, `cleanup_pane_identities`, `list_agents`, `check_file_reservation_conflicts`, `fetch_inbox_events`, and `get_message_delivery_receipt`.
- All 6 Rust-native tools are covered by dedicated golden fixtures under `tests/conformance/fixtures/rust_native/`.
- The former tool fixture gap tracked by `br-a2k3h.3` is closed by the dedicated Rust-native fixture lane.
- The live Rust router exposes 25 logical resource templates after collapsing `?{query}` variants.
- 23 resource templates have Python behavior fixtures.
- 2 Rust-only resources, `resource://tooling/metrics_core` and `resource://tooling/diagnostics`, are unit-tested in `mcp-agent-mail-tools` but still lack conformance fixtures. They are tracked by `br-a2k3h.4` and `br-a2k3h.6`.
- Resource parity coverage remains tracked by `br-a2k3h.4` and `br-a2k3h.6`.
- Python-parity fixture refresh now has a dedicated weekly automation lane via `scripts/regen_python_parity_fixtures.sh` and `.github/workflows/conformance-fixture-regen.yml`.

## Tool Classification

These classifications come from the live tool surface in `mcp_agent_mail_tools::TOOL_CLUSTER_MAP`,
the Python behavior fixture inventory in `tests/conformance/fixtures/python_reference.json`, and
the audit record in [docs/CONFORMANCE_AUDIT_2026-04-18.md](../../docs/CONFORMANCE_AUDIT_2026-04-18.md).

- `renew_file_reservations` - Extend active file reservation expiries in place.
- `force_release_file_reservation` - Break a stale reservation after abandonment heuristics.
- `search_messages` - Query message history through the unified search surface.
- `summarize_thread` - Summarize one thread or an aggregate of multiple threads.
- `macro_start_session` - Ensure project, register agent, reserve files, and fetch inbox in one step.
- `macro_prepare_thread` - Register, summarize a thread, and fetch inbox context in one step.
- `macro_file_reservation_cycle` - Reserve files and optionally auto-release them as a macro flow.
- `macro_contact_handshake` - Request contact, optionally approve it, and optionally send a welcome message.
- `ensure_product` - Create or resolve a product-bus product record.
- `products_link` - Link a project into a product scope.
- `search_messages_product` - Search across all projects linked to a product.
- `fetch_inbox_product` - Read inbox activity for one agent across linked projects.

- `release_build_slot` - Release an existing build slot lease.

### Rust-native extensions (6)

- `resolve_pane_identity` - Resolve the canonical agent name for a tmux pane from Rust-side identity files; there is no Python pane-identity analogue.
- `cleanup_pane_identities` - Remove stale per-pane identity files for dead tmux panes; this is Rust-only operational cleanup tied to the pane identity model.
- `list_agents` - List all registered agents in a project; this Rust-native identity surface is now covered by the dedicated `rust_native/` golden fixtures.
- `check_file_reservation_conflicts` - Read-only authoritative conflict check for pre-edit/pre-commit guards (added in `08b05c76`, GH#196); covered by the dedicated `rust_native/` golden fixtures.
- `fetch_inbox_events` - Read durable, body-free recipient delivery events with a restart-safe cursor; covered by the dedicated `rust_native/` golden fixtures.
- `get_message_delivery_receipt` - Read persisted, signaled, and acknowledged delivery state for one message; covered by dedicated `rust_native/` golden fixtures.
