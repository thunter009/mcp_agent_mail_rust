//! `am doctor robot-docs` — paste-ready agent handbook.
//!
//! When an agent invokes `am doctor` cold (no prior context), this is the

//! Output is Markdown to stdout; auto-disables ANSI on non-TTY.

//! Per the world-class-doctor-mode kernel (Axiom 0: first-try success),

const HANDBOOK_TEXT: &str = r#"# `am doctor` — Agent Handbook

You are an AI coding agent. The Agent Mail mailbox you depend on may have
drifted; `am doctor` is how you find out and how you fix it. The handbook
below is the single source of truth — you should not need to read source
or run other commands to use the doctor effectively.

## Orientation

`am doctor` diagnoses (and, with `--fix`, repairs) Agent Mail's mailbox
state: SQLite DB, Git-backed archive, MCP client configs, pre-commit guard,
runtime listener, environment, share/atc/search/identity state. Every
mutation is **backed up first**, **hash-witnessed**, and **reversible via
`am doctor undo <run-id>`**. The doctor never deletes user files; it
quarantines via rename.

## The 15 Verbs

| Verb | Purpose | Mutates? | Default exit |
|------|---------|----------|--------------|
| `am doctor check` (`--json`) | Run all detectors. Read-only. | No | 0 healthy / 1 findings |
| `am doctor fix --yes` | Run detectors + apply fixers. Backups first. | Yes (via `mutate()`) | 0 / 2 / 3 / 4 |
| `am doctor fix --dry-run` | Print the fix plan; do not execute. | No | 0 |
| `am doctor fix --only <fm-id>` | Run a single registered FM through the chokepoint. Exit equals the envelope's `exit_code`: 1 = findings remain, nothing mutated; 2 = partial fix. | Yes (via `mutate()`) | 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 64 |
| `am doctor fix --only <fm-id> --list` | Detect a single FM only — no chokepoint. | No | 0 |
| `am doctor fix --list` | Detect every registered FM in one round-trip. | No | 0 |
| `am doctor undo <run-id>` | Restore from `.doctor/runs/<run-id>/backups/`. | Yes (restore-only) | 0 / 3 |
| `am doctor capabilities --json` | Print machine-readable contract (detectors, fixers, fm_fixers, exit codes, env vars). | No | 0 |
| `am doctor fixers` | List all per-FM detector+fixer pairs in the registry. | No | 0 |
| `am doctor explain <id>` | Drill into one finding (latest run) or one registered FM (registry fallback). | No | 0 / 64 |
| `am doctor robot-docs` | This handbook. | No | 0 |
| `am doctor health` | One-line liveness summary. For CI. | No | 0 / 1 |
| `am doctor ls` | List `.doctor/runs/` entries. | No | 0 |
| `am doctor triage` | Mega-command: status + findings + plan + capabilities URL in one envelope; always includes a live mailbox probe (`live_health`) so it cannot report all-clear during an active failure. | No | 0 |
| `am doctor selftest` | Exercise mutate() primitives end-to-end in a tempdir. | No | 0 / 1 |

Legacy verbs preserved (use the typed forms above for new work):
`repair`, `backups`, `restore`, `reconstruct`, `archive-scan`,
`archive-verify`, `archive-normalize`, `fix` (without `--only`,
runs the legacy multi-detector flow), `fix-orphan-refs`,
`pack-archive`.

## Exit codes

| Code | Name | When |
|------|------|------|
| 0 | success_or_healthy | Clean diagnose, fix complete, undo complete |
| 1 | findings_present_no_fix | Diagnose found issues; `--fix` is recommended |
| 2 | fix_partial | `--fix`: some fixed, some not (see `report.json::partial_failures`) |
| 3 | fix_failed_rolled_back | At least one mutation failed; rolled back |
| 4 | refused_unsafe | State unsafe (schema mismatch, scope violation, unmet precondition) |
| 5 | concurrency_lost | Another doctor invocation holds the lock |
| 6 | online_required | At least one finding needs `--online`; not passed |
| 64 | usage_error | Unknown flag / missing arg (POSIX EX_USAGE) |
| 66 | no_input | Target path doesn't exist or isn't a recognized project |
| 73 | cant_create | Couldn't create `.doctor/runs/<run-id>/` |
| 74 | io_error | Filesystem I/O during read or non-mutating write |

## Five Recipes (Copy-Paste Ready)

### 1. Healthy-baseline triage (start of session)

```bash
am doctor --json | jq -e '.ok'
```

Returns `true` healthy, `false` with findings. If false:

```bash
am doctor --json | jq '.findings[] | {id, severity, title}'
```

### 2. Plan-then-fix workflow

```bash
am doctor --dry-run --fix          # preview
am doctor --fix                    # apply with backups
am doctor                          # confirm exit 0
```

### 3. Reverse a fix that went wrong

```bash
am doctor undo latest              # most recent
# or:
am doctor ls                       # see all runs
am doctor undo 2026-05-09T16-30-15Z__abc123
```

### 4. Pre-commit fast path

```bash
am doctor --quick --json           # < 200ms; only fast detectors
```

Use as a pre-commit gate; fail if exit 1.

### 5. Targeted scope (one finding at a time)

```bash
am doctor --json | jq -r '.findings[0].id'           # get a finding id
am doctor explain <finding-id>                        # see evidence
am doctor fix --only <fm-id> --yes                   # apply just that fix
```

`am doctor explain` falls back to the registry when no recent
run includes the id, so `am doctor explain <fm-id>` works cold —
useful for understanding what an FM does before invoking it.

### 6. Per-FM surface (recommended for agents)

```bash
am doctor fixers --format json | jq '.fixers[].id'   # enumerate registered FMs
am doctor fix --list --json                           # detect across every FM
am doctor fix --only <fm-id> --list --json            # preview one FM's findings
am doctor fix --only <fm-id> --dry-run                # rehearse through chokepoint
am doctor fix --only <fm-id> --yes                    # apply that one FM's fix
am doctor undo latest                                 # rollback if needed
```

The per-FM verbs route every mutation through the `mutate()`
chokepoint: verbatim backups in `<run-dir>/backups/seq_<ns>/`,
hash-witnessed actions in `actions.jsonl`, reversible via undo.
The legacy `am doctor fix` (without `--only`) runs the older
multi-detector flow; prefer the per-FM verbs when targeting
specific failure modes.

### 7. One-shot system survey

```bash
am doctor fix --list --json | jq '{
  total: .total_findings,
  by_severity: (.per_fm | group_by(.severity) | map({(.[0].severity): map(.findings_count) | add}) | add),
  per_fm: (.per_fm | map(select(.findings_count > 0)) | map({fm_id, findings_count, actions_planned})),
  skipped: .skipped
}'
```

Single round-trip: every registered FM's detector runs, findings
aggregate, FMs missing required inputs (e.g., git not on PATH for
known-bad-git, or `:memory:` DB URL for storage-db chmod) are
surfaced in `skipped[]` with the missing field name.

## Per-run artifacts

Every `--fix` run creates `.doctor/runs/<ISO>__<run-id>/`:

```
.doctor/runs/2026-05-09T16-30-15Z__abc123/
├── report.json           # findings + summary; same shape as `--json` output
├── report.md             # human-readable narrative
├── actions.jsonl         # one line per mutate() call (before/after hashes)
├── backups/              # verbatim per-file copies (preserves perms, mtime)
├── stderr.log
├── stdout.json
└── undo.sh               # idempotent shell script wrapping `am doctor undo`
```

`.doctor/latest` is an atomic symlink to the most recent run.

`.doctor/scorecard_history.jsonl` is the per-run trend timeseries (one line
per run, ordered by start time).

`.doctor/` is added to `.gitignore` automatically on first run.

## Hard guarantees (kernel axioms applied)

- **Detect-then-fix**: detectors are pure; nothing writes without `--fix`.
- **Single chokepoint**: every disk write under `--fix` flows through
  one `mutate()` function. Verified by `validate-doctor.sh`.
- **Backup before mutation**: `mutate()` writes a verbatim backup BEFORE
  changing anything. `cmp_strict(backup, live)` succeeds at backup time.
- **Hash witness**: every mutation records `{path, op, before_hash,
  after_hash, started_at_ns, finished_at_ns, run_id, fixer_id, ok}` in
  `actions.jsonl`. SHA-256.
- **Reversible**: `undo <run-id>` reads `actions.jsonl` in reverse,
  restores from `backups/`, verifies hash. Fails closed if any backup
  is missing.
- **Idempotent**: `--fix` then `--fix` → second run reports `actions_taken: 0`.
- **Concurrency-safe**: two `--fix` invocations → one wins, the other
  refuses with exit 5.
- **Crash-recoverable**: SIGKILL mid-fix → next run finishes or aborts
  cleanly. Atomic write-tmp-rename throughout.
- **Read-only by default**: bare `am doctor` never mutates state.
- **Stable JSON schema**: `--json` always includes `schema_version`.
- **Stdout = data, stderr = progress**: `--json | jq` is always safe.
- **Offline by default**: network probes opt-in via `--online`.

## What `am doctor --fix` will NOT do (per AGENTS.md + safety envelope)

- Delete user files (rename to `<run-dir>/quarantine/<rel>` instead).
- Run `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`.
- Edit your shell rc files (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) — emits a finding.
- Modify canonical mail messages under `<storage_root>/projects/<slug>/messages/`.
- Touch `~/.gitconfig` or `~/.git-credentials`.
- Send any `send_message` call (broadcast or otherwise — Rule 2 of AGENTS.md).
- Probe network unless `--online` is set.
- Mutate while another doctor invocation holds the lock.

## Capabilities (machine-readable contract)

```bash
am doctor capabilities --json | jq '.detectors | length'   # 30+
am doctor capabilities --json | jq '.fixers | length'
am doctor capabilities --json | jq '.exit_codes | keys'    # ["0","1","2","3","4","5","6","64","66","73","74"]
am doctor capabilities --json | jq '.subsystems'           # 11 subsystems
am doctor capabilities --json | jq '.write_scopes'         # paths doctor may touch
```

## Subsystem reference

The 11 subsystems doctor covers (each has its own detectors/fixers):

1. `db_state_files` — SQLite DB, WAL/SHM, schema, FTS, search V3 index
2. `archive_state_files` — Git archive, project.json, locks, refs/objects
3. `runtime_processes` — listener, port, supervisor, PID hints
4. `mcp_config_files` — Claude/Codex/Gemini/Cursor/Cline/etc. configs
5. `secrets_env_state` — bearer tokens, JWT keys, env files
6. `guard_install` — pre-commit hook integrity, archive read, rename handling
7. `environment_toolchain` — git version, PATH, installed agents
8. `share_export_state` — share bundles, scrub, manifests, signatures
9. `atc_learning_state` — ATC durability, write_mode, rollups
10. `search_index_state` — Search V3 / frankensearch index hygiene
11. `identity_contacts_state` — agents, contacts, build_slots, pane identity

## When stuck: meta-recovery

If `am doctor` itself doesn't run (binary missing, locked):

```bash
# 1. Check the lock
cat <repo>/.doctor/.doctor.lock 2>/dev/null
# fs2 advisory lock dies with the holding process; if held, find that process.

# 2. Read the latest run manually
cat <repo>/.doctor/latest/report.json

# 3. Replay actions.jsonl in reverse without `am doctor undo`
tac <repo>/.doctor/runs/<id>/actions.jsonl | while read line; do
  path=$(echo "$line" | jq -r .path)
  cp "<repo>/.doctor/runs/<id>/backups/$path" "<repo>/$path"
done
```

## Versioning

- `tool_version` — am binary semver
- `doctor_version` — implementation version (minor for new fixers)
- `doctor_contract_version` — agent-facing contract (major-bump on breaks)

You only need to track `doctor_contract_version`. Read it from
`am doctor capabilities --json | jq -r .doctor_contract_version`.
