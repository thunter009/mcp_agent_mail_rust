//! `fm-db-state-files-reservation-db-archive-parity` — P1
//! detect-only.
//!
//! **Subsystem**: db_state_files.
//!
//! ## What's broken
//!
//! File reservations are represented twice:
//!
//! - SQLite rows in `file_reservations` plus the
//!   `file_reservation_releases` sidecar ledger.
//! - Stable archive artifacts at
//!   `<storage_root>/projects/<slug>/file_reservations/id-<id>.json`.
//!
//! The pre-commit guard and human archive review consume the archive side,
//! while MCP tools primarily read SQLite. If those stores disagree, a held
//! reservation can over-block, under-block, or resurrect after release.
//!
//! ## Detection
//!
//! Opens each candidate DB read-only/immutable and runs the shared
//! reservation parity checker from `mcp-agent-mail-tools`. The checker
//! compares stable reservation ids, holder agent names, effective release
//! timestamps (`file_reservation_releases` wins over the hot row), active
//! status, and thread/reason provenance.
//!
//! ## Fix
//!
//! Auto-fix reconciles the two drift classes from `mcp_agent_mail_rust#112`
//! (52% stale `agent_id`, 10% stuck-NULL `released_ts`) through the doctor
//! `mutate()` chokepoint (hash-witnessed, `undo`-reversible, behind `--yes`).
//! Each reconcile direction has a *principled winner*, never a guess:
//!
//! - **Release is monotonic and irreversible → released wins.** If either store
//!   records a release, the reservation is released; the lagging store is synced
//!   to the earliest known `released_ts`. A stuck-NULL DB row (over-blocking, the
//!   #112 harm) is updated via a batched `Op::DbExec` (hot row + the durable
//!   `file_reservation_releases` ledger); a stale-active archive artifact is
//!   rewritten via `Op::WriteFile` (only its `released_ts` field changes).
//! - **Holder on a still-active reservation → the immutable acquire-time archive
//!   wins.** The `id-<id>.json` artifact is written once at acquire and is the
//!   human-auditable record of the holder, while the DB hot row is what drifts
//!   under the #112 atomicity bug. The DB `agent_id` is updated via `Op::DbExec`
//!   — but only when the archive's holder resolves to a *registered* agent in the
//!   project. If it does not, the row is genuinely ambiguous: the fixer refuses
//!   to guess and leaves it for manual reconciliation.
//!
//! Cross-project global-id collisions (GH#167) are quarantined via `Op::Rename`
//! as before. Every remaining drift class (`path_pattern`, `exclusive`,
//! `thread_provenance`, `missing_archive`, `archive_without_db`) stays
//! detect-only: it needs operator-supplied truth about which side is
//! authoritative.
//!
//! Every archive mutation resolves its target with the same generation
//! attribution the detector used (`report.live_generation`): the
//! current-generation or legacy artifact, never a prior-generation
//! `id-<id>-g<other>.json` (GH#311). Foreign-generation artifacts are history,
//! not drift, and are left byte-identical; if the flagged artifact cannot be
//! identified unambiguously the fixer skips it and the drift stays visible in
//! the post-fix detection.
