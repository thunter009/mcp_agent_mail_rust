//! Centralized mailbox durability verdict computation.
//!
//! This module provides the authoritative health-verdict engine consumed by
//! startup, doctor, CLI, and server code. It implements the state machine
//! defined in `docs/SPEC-mailbox-durability-states.md`.
//!
//! # States
//!
//! - `Healthy`: All probes pass, ready for reads and writes
//! - `Stale`: DB accessible but may not reflect latest archive state
//! - `Suspect`: Anomalies detected but not definitively broken
//! - `Broken`: Definitively corrupted or inaccessible
//! - `Recovering`: Exclusive recovery operation in progress
//! - `DegradedReadOnly`: Safe for reads but writes blocked
//! - `Escalate`: Requires human intervention
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use mcp_agent_mail_db::mailbox_verdict::{compute_mailbox_verdict, VerdictOptions};
//!
//! let verdict = compute_mailbox_verdict(database_url, archive_root, &VerdictOptions::default());
//! if verdict.state.allows_writes() {
//!     // Safe to proceed with mutations
//! }
//! ```
