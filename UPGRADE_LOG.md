# Dependency Upgrade Log

## September 16, 2026 — release qualification update

Version remains 0.3.35; the next application release is not published. This
section supersedes the current-status statements in the historical September 12
notes below.

- The original WAL/doctor failures were repaired. The final September 12
  workspace run at `0259279b` passed **17,510 tests, zero failures, 39 skipped**.
  That result includes Comrak 0.55.0 and ChaCha20 0.10.2, but does not qualify
  the subsequent September 15–16 changes.
- FastMCP remains 0.7.1 with all eight packages pinned to immutable revision
  `c14d26b49f132625f4141b72669b157467b9aac2`. This backports protocol negotiation
  for GH #321 while preserving the exact Asupersync 0.4.9 runtime family.
  The fresh consumer passed 18 stdio assertions and real HTTP initialization
  for four proposed protocol versions, including subsequent tool discovery.
- FrankenSQLite remains 0.3.18 with all 20 packages pinned to immutable revision
  `2633b38a26bde68db23172b12aa402ed698cc309`, published as
  `am-sql-compat-20260916`. It retains the SQL/WAL compatibility corrections
  and fixes a Windows namespace probe that compared a file identity with its
  mutex. Native Windows namespace tests passed 42/42; Linux generation tests
  passed 3/3 and strict VFS Clippy passed. Adoption changed only the 20 engine
  source revisions in Cargo.lock; unrelated package versions and edges were
  preserved.
- Windows consumer qualification subsequently exposed Unix-only imports in
  archive recovery test helpers (br-dlurv). The helpers are corrected, but the
  rebuilt consumer and native recovery tests remain pending. Engine tests alone
  do not qualify the application.
- The current Linux full run selects 17,540 tests across 149 binaries and is
  still running. Current-pin rollback tests, final compiler gates, macOS native
  qualification, six-platform release binaries, signatures, installation, and
  venue publication remain open. The retained logs are under
  `/data/projects/am-release-20260912/`.
- The unadopted dependency candidates below remain deferred while release bugs
  are fixed. Their September 12 version research is historical, not a claim
  that every listed package is still latest or has been individually validated.

## September 12, 2026 — next release (br-xql74)

Status: in progress; no new version, tag, or publication yet. Baseline source
`5d2f6af863de1d021fb6ee862fb5f928f6168d0e`, version 0.3.35.
The older June entries below are historical evidence, not current release gates.

Live registry research covered 89 direct packages: 54 already current and 35
newer packages grouped into 18 coherent upgrade units. Preserve Tantivy's git
revision and the gated FrankenSearch path dependencies. FrankenSQLite 0.3.18
is already latest stable.

- Updated: Comrak 0.54.0 → 0.55.0. Fixes two autolink denial-of-service
  issues ([GHSA-xg9p-p4jc-c46g](https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak/security/advisories/GHSA-xg9p-p4jc-c46g)).
  No use of its deprecated `tagfilter` option was found. Strict-RCH Markdown
  regression selection passed 152 tests (5008 unselected), remote exit 0 on
  `am-release-css` at 2026-09-12 01:15:04 UTC. Full workspace nextest then
  started at source `046976941fa4933b8209decc591975c454713518` and finished
  with 17,484 passed, 19 failed and 39 skipped. Remote nextest exited 100;
  the outer RCH exited 103 because its post-run source receipt detected local
  changes and generated artifacts. This baseline has no frozen-source verdict.
- Pending, individually tested: indexmap 2.14.2; plist 1.10.1; smallvec 1.16.1;
  toml_edit 0.25.15; tru 0.2.4; franken-agent-detection 0.2.4;
  tokenizers 0.23.2; wide 1.7.0; blake2 0.11.0; dirs 7.0.0;
  winsafe 0.0.29; beads_rust 0.5.12; SQLModel family 0.4.3; FTUI family 0.7.0.
- Updated, whole-workspace validation pending: ChaCha20 0.10.1 → 0.10.2, replacing
  the yanked version and fixing an SSE2 portability defect. Only that package's
  version/checksum changes in Cargo.lock; an unrelated resolver change to
  tempfile's getrandom edge was manually restored, and `cargo tree --locked`
  accepted the preserved graph. The dependency is used through Asupersync and
  FrankenSQLite, not the share module's external `age` executable.
  The queued DB/conformance gate refused after the baseline exceeded the
  ten-failure circuit breaker; that queue ran no tests. After the user's
  instruction to fix the bugs, focused DB/search/cursor/load validation passed
  135 tests with this lockfile. The complete fixture-router test subsequently
  passed in the 14-test portability selection.
- Constrained: latest FastMCP 0.9.0 requires asupersync exactly 0.4.10 and
  Rust 1.100, while even latest beads_rust requires asupersync exactly 0.4.9.
  The workspace's Rust minimum was corrected to 1.100 as described below.
  Latest asupersync 0.4.11 satisfies neither exact pin. Keep the coherent
  existing runtime family; do not substitute mutable sibling checkouts.
- Compatible FastMCP candidate: 0.8.1 keeps asupersync exactly 0.4.9 and
  isolates `block_on` runtimes per thread, directly relevant to AM dispatch.
  The installed nightly is Rust 1.100.0-nightly and satisfies its floor.
  Existing explicit-context runner calls appear compatible; compile and real
  transport tests are pending. Both current and candidate FastMCP clients pin
  TOML exactly 1.1.4, preventing a standalone upgrade to TOML 1.1.6.
- Release gates pending: complete workspace tests, check, strict Clippy,
  formatting, security audit, six-platform portable builds, signed artifacts,
  installation/update checks, and applicable distribution venue verification.
- Corrected the workspace Rust minimum from 1.95 to 1.100, matching the
  already-selected FastMCP 0.7.1 manifest. The pinned nightly is unchanged.
  `cargo metadata --locked --no-deps` confirms all 12 active members inherit
  1.100; this is a metadata check, not a compiler or runtime test result.
- Remaining release failures include WAL-only CHECK violation setup, WAL-only
  schema-version visibility, structural-corruption authority with a live owner,
  live physical-copy admission, canonical-reader close/checkpoint visibility,
  and reconstructed-mailbox search freshness (repair validation below). The physical-copy guard preserves
  process-wide file locks. Existing assertions and that guard remain unchanged.
- Guarded live-search refresh repair: native live sources use namespace-bound
  read-only opens for the scan, all reopen retries and the final publication
  seal. Private snapshots remain query authority. Canonical/archive fallback
  sources cannot publish live index state. Failed refreshes retain private
  results with an explicit warning and actual bootstrap-error health; cached
  failure requires revalidation before success can be recorded.
  The original recovery test and guarded source-preservation tests passed in
  an 87-test remote selection. The new real writer-lock regression then caught
  false fresh health (88/89 passed); recording the actual refresh error passed
  all 89 tests. A separate stale-binary rerun omitted the two new tests despite
  synchronized source hashes and is excluded as final-candidate evidence.
  Final retry/recovery additions and the broader search-service selection
  passed all 232 tests through strict RCH (6796 unselected, remote exit 0).
  Source hashes match the frozen candidate. Workspace/all-target check and
  strict Clippy passed remotely at 13:50:16 and 13:52:22 UTC; formatting and
  diff checks passed. UBS remains reviewed nonzero: 119 critical, 4597 warnings
  and 1324 informational findings, with no suppression. Five other runtime
  failures still block release. Logs and SHA-256 receipts are retained under
  `/data/projects/am-release-20260912/live-refresh-*`.
- Fixed source-change retry and relevance cursor behavior passed 135 focused
  tests through strict RCH, including the real mutation-during-scan and
  pagination-under-writes regressions (3808 tests unselected, remote exit 0).
  The first repair run retained one pagination failure out of 99 tests before
  the cursor correction. Logs are in `/data/projects/am-release-20260912/`.
  The conformance/server/share portability selection passed all 14 tests
  (5959 unselected, remote exit 0), including the eight previously failing
  environment-sensitive tests. Its first build failed because the new fixture
  helper assumed SHA-1's digest implemented LowerHex; explicit byte encoding
  corrected that compile error. The rerun used the normal remote checkout,
  not a relocated source-content checkout. Publication remains blocked.
- The repaired candidate passed strict-RCH workspace/all-target `cargo check`
  and Clippy with `-D warnings` (remote exits 0 at 03:39:27 and 03:41:32 UTC).
  `cargo fmt --check` and `git diff --check` also passed. UBS remains a reviewed
  nonzero scan under the previously approved exception: 131 critical findings,
  1789 warnings and 436 informational findings; no suppression or clean-scan
  claim. The final digest-encoding correction was manually reviewed.
- Initial post-Comrak `cargo audit --json` completed with zero vulnerabilities.
  Audit success is separate from the focused Markdown test result above and
  does not establish whole-workspace runtime compatibility.
  This is not a clean security audit: separate warnings include unsound
  `lru 0.16.4` (RUSTSEC-2026-0253) through the gated FrankenSearch lexical
  crate's registry Tantivy 0.26.1, unmaintained `paste` and `rustls-pemfile`,
  and yanked `chacha20 0.10.1`. Compatible remediation is under investigation.
  Follow-up: ChaCha20 0.10.2 is compatible and fixes an SSE2 portability bug;
  its isolated update/test is pending. LRU's patched range is >=0.18.2;
  even Tantivy 0.26.2 retains `lru ^0.16.3`, and the gated source pins
  Tantivy exactly 0.26.1. Its sole `LruCache<usize, Block>` does not supply
  the advisory's panicking-key destructor trigger, but it remains unpatched.
  Preserve that constraint and warning rather than suppressing it or dropping
  the production lexical backend. A fix needs a separately reviewed immutable
  sibling revision or backport.
- Venue preflight: GitHub Actions permissions report `enabled=false`.
  Homebrew is already at 0.3.35 with four platform hashes. GHCR `latest` has
  amd64/arm64 images labelled 0.3.34 at source `0125f0505fa0ba604dbbbb580fad56d283e46488`.
  The three probed Agent Mail package names return crates.io 404 and every
  active workspace member remains `publish=false`; gated path/git dependencies
  still prevent treating this as an existing crates.io publication stream.


**Date:** 2026-06-11 | **Project:** mcp_agent_mail_rust | **Language:** Rust

## Summary

- **Updated:** local `/dp` dependency alignment, direct manifest floors, and compatible lockfile refreshes.
- **Skipped:** incompatible major-version lockfile upgrades constrained by upstream dependency ranges; crates.io publishing is intentionally disabled for all workspace members.
- **Failed:** none in the completed compiler, lint, and workspace test gates.
- **Needs attention:** binary release packaging and external distribution verification remain separate release gates.

## Updates

### Local /dp dependency alignment

- `fastmcp*`: `0.3.0` -> `0.3.1` to match `/dp/fastmcp_rust`.
- `sqlmodel*`: `0.2.1` -> `0.2.2` to match `/dp/sqlmodel_rust`.
- `ftui*`: `0.3.1` -> `0.4.0` to match `/dp/frankentui`.
- `beads_rust`: `0.2.6` -> `0.2.7` to match `/dp/beads_rust`.
- Removed the unused `sqlmodel-frankensqlite` patch entry because the active workspace graph does not depend on that package; keeping it caused Cargo patch warnings.

### 2026-06-11 local /dp refresh

- `asupersync`: `0.3.3` -> `0.3.4` to match `/dp/asupersync`.
- `beads_rust`: manifest constraint `0.2.10` -> `0.2.15` to match `/dp/beads_rust`.
- `franken-agent-detection`: `0.1.7` -> `0.1.8` to match `/dp/franken_agent_detection`.
- `frankensearch`: `0.3.0` -> `0.3.2` to match `/dp/frankensearch/frankensearch`.
- `frankensearch-core`, `frankensearch-embed`, `frankensearch-index`, `frankensearch-fusion`: `0.2.0` -> `0.2.1` to match the current local `/dp/frankensearch` crate versions.

### Compatible registry updates

- `tru`/`toon`: `0.2.2` -> `0.2.3`.
- `zip`: manifest floor tightened to `8.6.0` after lockfile resolution selected it.

### Manifest-level latest-stable updates

- `comrak`: `0.50.0` -> `0.52.0`.
- `crossterm`: `0.28.1` -> `0.29.0`.
- `getrandom`: `0.2.17` -> `0.4.2`; call sites now use `getrandom::fill`.
- `insta`: manifest floor tightened from `1.38` to the resolved current `1.47.2`.
- `json5`: `0.4.1` -> `1.3.1`.
- `plist`: `1.8.0` -> `1.9.0`.
- `sha1`: `0.10.6` -> `0.11.0`.
- `sha2`: `0.10.9` -> `0.11.0`.
- `similar`: `2.7.0` -> `3.1.0`.
- `tantivy`: `0.25.0` -> `0.26.1`.
- `tokenizers`: `0.22.2` -> `0.23.1`.
- `unicode-width`: `0.1.14` -> `0.2.2`.

### 2026-06-11 latest-stable direct registry refresh

- `git2`: `0.20.4` -> `0.21.0`; current source uses stable repository/status/diff APIs.
- `toml_edit`: `0.23.10+spec-1.0.0` -> `0.25.12+spec-1.1.0`; current source uses `DocumentMut`, `Item`, `Array`, and `value` APIs.
- `safetensors`: `0.7.0` -> `0.8.0`; no direct source call sites, optional dependency only.
- `wide`: `1.4.0` -> `1.5.0`; no direct source call sites, dependency surface only.

### 2026-06-11 compatible transitive refresh

- Ran `cargo update`, resolving 54 package changes including `chrono`, `dashmap`, `minijinja`, `regex`, `uuid`, `wasm-bindgen`, `zerocopy`, and related transitive crates to their latest compatible stable versions.

### 2026-06-11 final compatible lockfile refresh

- Ran a final `cargo update` after the local `/dp` fixes and workspace test corrections.
- Compatible lockfile updates included `block-buffer` `0.12.0` -> `0.12.1`, `insta` `1.47.2` -> `1.48.0`, `memchr` `2.8.1` -> `2.8.2`, and `smallvec` `1.15.1` -> `1.15.2`.
- Remaining known newer versions are constrained by dependency ranges rather than local pins: `generic-array` `0.14.7` (latest `0.14.9`) and `shlex` `1.3.0` (latest `2.0.1`).

## Verification

- `cargo fmt --check`: passed.
- `cargo check --workspace --all-targets`: passed.
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`: passed.
- `cargo test --workspace`: passed.
- `cargo test --workspace --all-features`: passed, including doctests.

## Failed

- None in the dependency update, format, compile, lint, default test, or all-features test pass.

## Needs Attention

- `cargo outdated` cannot inspect this workspace directly because it copies the manifest to a temporary directory where relative `/dp` patches like `../asupersync` resolve to missing paths such as `/tmp/asupersync`. I am using `cargo update --dry-run --verbose`, `cargo metadata`, and direct local manifest checks instead.
- All workspace crates currently set `publish = false`. `.github/workflows/publish.yml` is a manual publishability preflight only and documents that crates.io publication is blocked until unpublished sibling path dependencies are independently published and the workspace publication policy changes.
