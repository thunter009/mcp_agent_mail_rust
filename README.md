## TL;DR

**The Problem**: Modern projects often run multiple coding agents at once (backend, frontend, scripts, infra). Without a shared coordination fabric, agents overwrite each other's edits, miss critical context from parallel workstreams, and require humans to relay messages across tools and teams.

**The Solution**: Agent Mail gives every coding agent a persistent identity (e.g., `GreenCastle`), an inbox/outbox, searchable threaded conversations, and advisory file reservations (leases) to signal editing intent. Everything is backed by Git for human-auditable artifacts and SQLite for fast indexing and search.

### Why Use Agent Mail?

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Advisory File Reservations** | Agents declare exclusive or shared leases on file globs before editing, preventing conflicts with a pre-commit guard |
| **Asynchronous Messaging** | Threaded inbox/outbox with subjects, CC/BCC, acknowledgments, and importance levels |
| **Token-Efficient** | Messages stored in a per-project archive, not in agent context windows |
| **25 MCP Resources** | Read-only inbox, thread, reservation, tooling, identity, and attention views for cheap lookups |
| **48 MCP Tools** | Infrastructure, identity, messaging, contacts, reservations, search, macros, product bus, and build slots |
| **16-Screen TUI** | Live operator cockpit for messages, threads, agents, search, reservations, metrics, health, analytics, attachments, archive browsing, and ATC |
| **Web UI** | Server-rendered `/mail/` routes for human oversight, unified inbox review, search, attachments, and overseer messaging |
| **Robot Mode** | 18 agent-optimized CLI subcommands with `toon`/`json`/`md` output for non-interactive workflows |
| **Git-Backed Archive** | Every message, reservation, and agent profile stored as files in per-project Git repos |
| **Hybrid Search** | Search V3 via frankensearch. The lexical tier ships by default; semantic and hybrid routing are controlled by the hybrid feature flag (`feature = "hybrid"`). |
| **Pre-Commit Guard** | Git hook that blocks commits touching files reserved by other agents |
| **Dual-Mode Interface** | MCP server (`mcp-agent-mail`) and operator CLI (`am`) share tools but enforce strict surface separation |

### Quick Example

```bash
# Install and start (auto-detects all installed coding agents)
am

# That's it. Server starts on 127.0.0.1:8765 with the interactive TUI.

# Agents coordinate through MCP tools:
#   ensure_project(human_key="/abs/path")
#   register_agent(project_key="/abs/path", program="claude-code", model="opus-4.6")
#   file_reservation_paths(project_key="/abs/path", agent_name="BlueLake", paths=["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)
#   send_message(project_key="/abs/path", sender_name="BlueLake", to=["GreenCastle"], subject="Starting refactor", body_md="Taking src/**", thread_id="FEAT-123")
#   fetch_inbox(project_key="/abs/path", agent_name="BlueLake")

# Or use the robot CLI for non-interactive agent workflows:
am robot status --project /abs/path --agent BlueLake
am robot inbox --project /abs/path --agent BlueLake --urgent --format json
am robot reservations --project /abs/path --agent BlueLake --conflicts
```

### What Agent Conversations Look Like

Example exchange between two agents coordinating a refactor:

```

No human relay needed. Agents negotiate file ownership, flag breaking changes in real time, and hand off work through structured, threaded messages stored in Git.

## Why This Exists

Modern projects often run multiple coding agents at once (backend, frontend, scripts, infra). Without a shared coordination fabric, agents overwrite each other's edits, miss critical context from parallel workstreams, and require humans to relay messages across tools and teams.

Agent Mail has been available since October 2025 and was designed around real multi-agent coding workloads across providers such as Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI. The adjacent [Beads](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) and [bv](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) tools make it more useful as a full coordination stack: Beads tracks work, bv helps pick the right next work, and Agent Mail carries the coordination traffic.

### The Footguns Agent Mail Avoids

**No "broadcast to all" mode.** Given the option, many agents will overuse broadcast-style messaging. That is the equivalent of default reply-all in email: lots of irrelevant noise and wasted context.

**Carefully refined API ergonomics.** Bad MCP documentation and poor agent ergonomics quietly wreck reliability. Agent Mail's 48 tool definitions have gone through repeated real-world iteration so they work predictably without wasting tokens.

**No git worktrees.** Worktrees can slow development velocity and create reconciliation debt when agents diverge. Agent Mail takes the opposite approach: keep agents in one shared space, surface conflicts quickly, and give them tools to coordinate through them.

**Advisory file reservations instead of hard locks.** For this problem, advisory reservations fit better than hard locks. Agents can temporarily claim files while they work, reservations expire automatically, and stale claims can be reclaimed. That makes the system robust to crashed or reset agents; hard locks would not.

**Semi-persistent identity.** An identity that can last for the duration of a discrete task (for the purpose of coordination), but one that can also vanish without a trace and not break things. You don't want ringleader agents whose death takes down the whole system. Agent Mail identities are memorable (e.g., `GreenCastle`), but ephemeral by design.

**Graph-aware task selection.** If you have 200-500 tasks, you don't want agents randomly choosing them or wasting context communicating about what to do. There's usually a "right answer" for what each agent should work on, and that right answer comes from the dependency structure of the tasks. That's what [bv](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) computes using graph theory, like a compass that tells each agent which direction will unlock the most work overall.

### What Agent Mail Gives You

- **Prevents conflicts:** Explicit file reservations (leases) for files/globs prevent agents from overwriting each other
- **Reduces human relay work:** Agents send messages directly to each other with threaded conversations, acknowledgments, and priority levels
- **Keeps communication off the token budget:** Messages stored in per-project Git archive, not consuming agent context windows
- **Offers quick reads:** `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>`, `resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>`, and 31 other MCP resources
- **Provides full audit trails:** Every instruction, lease, message, and attachment is in Git for human review
- **Scales across repos:** Frontend and backend agents in different repos coordinate through the product bus and contact system

### Typical Use Cases

- Multiple agents splitting a large refactor across services while staying in sync
- Frontend and backend agent teams coordinating thread-by-thread across repositories
- Protecting critical migrations with exclusive file reservations and pre-commit guards
- Searching and summarizing long technical discussions as threads evolve
- Running agent swarms with [Beads](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) task tracking for dependency-aware work selection

### Productivity Math

Parallel agent work changes the economics of supervision. One human operator can spend an hour steering several agents while those agents produce many hours of implementation work in parallel. The exact multiplier depends on the task and on how disciplined the workflow is, but the point is straightforward: coordination overhead matters, and Agent Mail is built to keep that overhead low.

## Design Philosophy

**Mail metaphor, not chat.** Agents send discrete messages with subjects, recipients, and thread IDs. Work coordination is structured communication with clear intent, not a firehose. Imagine if your email system at work defaulted to reply-all every time; that's what chat-based coordination does, and it burns context fast.

**SQLite for live state, Git for the durable ledger.** The accepted write path mutates SQLite first so inboxes, resources, TUI, web, and robot views see one fresh operational state. The same write then emits human-readable message, profile, and reservation artifacts into the per-project Git archive for audit and recovery.

**Advisory, not mandatory.** File reservations are advisory leases, not hard locks. The pre-commit guard enforces them at commit time, but agents can always override if needed. Deadlocks become impossible while accidental conflicts still get caught. Reservations expire on a TTL, so crashed agents don't hold files hostage forever.

**Resilient to agent death.** Agents die all the time: context windows overflow, sessions crash, memory gets wiped. Any agent can vanish without breaking the system. No ringleader agents, no single points of failure. Semi-persistent identities exist for coordination but don't create hard dependencies.

**Dual persistence.** Human-readable Markdown in Git for auditability; SQLite for live indexing plus Search V3 for fast lexical/semantic retrieval. Both stay in sync through the write pipeline.

**Structured concurrency, no Tokio.** The entire async stack uses [asupersync](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/asupersync) with `Cx`-threaded structured concurrency. No orphan tasks, cancel-correct channels, and deterministic testing with virtual time.

## Rust vs. Python: Stress Test Results

The Python implementation had three recurring failure modes under real multi-agent workloads: Git lock file contention from concurrent writes, SQLite pool exhaustion under sustained load, and cascading failures when many agents hit the server simultaneously. The Rust rewrite was designed specifically to eliminate these, and a dedicated stress test suite proves it.

### The 10-Test Gauntlet

| Test | Result | Key Metrics |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 30-agent message pipeline | PASS | 150/150 success, p99=6.8s, 0 errors |
| 10-project concurrent ops | PASS | 150/150 success, 0 errors |
| Commit coalescer batching | PASS | 9.1x batching ratio (100 writes &rarr; 11 commits) |
| Stale git lock recovery | PASS | Lock detected, cleaned, writes resumed |
| Mixed reservations + messages | PASS | 80+80 ops, 0 errors |
| WBQ saturation | PASS | 2000/2000 enqueued, 0 errors, 0 fallbacks |
| Pool exhaustion (60 threads, pool=15) | PASS | 600/600 success, 0 timeouts, 24 ops/sec |
| Sustained 30s mixed workload | PASS | 1494 ops, ~49 RPS, p99=2.6s, 0 errors |
| Thundering herd (50 threads, 1 agent) | PASS | All 50 got same ID, 0 errors |
| Inbox reads during message storm | PASS | 150 sends + 300 reads, 0 errors |

### Python Problem &rarr; Rust Fix

| Python Failure Mode | What the Rust Tests Exercise | Result |
|---------------------|------------------------------|--------|
| **Git lock file contention** | Commit coalescer batching (100 concurrent writes &rarr; 11 commits, 9.1x reduction), stale lock recovery, multi-project isolation | 0 lock errors |
| **SQLite pool exhaustion** | 60 threads on pool of 15, sustained 50 RPS for 30s, thundering herd (50 threads &rarr; 1 agent) | 0 timeouts, 0 DB errors |
| **Overloading with many agents** | 30 agents &times; 5 messages, 10 projects &times; 5 agents, 2000 WBQ operations, mixed reservation+message workload | 0 errors across all |

### What Makes the Difference

- **Git lock contention eliminated.** The commit coalescer batches rapid-fire writes into far fewer git commits (9.1x reduction observed). Lock-free git plumbing commits avoid `index.lock` entirely in most cases.
- **Pool exhaustion handled gracefully.** Even with 4x more threads than pool connections (60 vs 15), all 600 operations succeeded with 0 timeouts. WAL mode + a bounded 20s `busy_timeout` lets writers queue rather than fail (and give up before the 30s client deadline).
- **Stale lock recovery works.** Crashed-process lock files are detected via PID checking and cleaned up automatically, so a dead agent never holds the archive hostage.
- **Write-behind queue backpressure is clean.** 2000 rapid-fire enqueues from 20 threads &mdash; all accepted with 0 fallbacks or errors.
- **Read/write concurrency is solid.** Concurrent inbox reads and message writes produce 0 errors. WAL mode allows unlimited readers alongside writers.

The stress tests live in `crates/mcp-agent-mail-storage/tests/stress_pipeline.rs` (Rust unit tests targeting the DB+Git pipeline) and `tests/e2e/test_stress_load.sh` (HTTP E2E tests hammering a live server through the full network&rarr;server&rarr;DB&rarr;git pipeline).

## Installation

### One-Liner (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail_rust/main/install.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash
```

Downloads the right binary for your platform, installs to `~/.local/bin`, optionally updates your `PATH`, and auto-configures detected Codex CLI configs for HTTP MCP URL mode. Supports `--verify` for checksum + Sigstore cosign verification.

Options: `--version vX.Y.Z`, `--dest DIR`, `--system` (installs to `/usr/local/bin`), `--from-source`, `--verify`, `--easy-mode` (auto-update PATH), `--force`, `--no-service` (never install/modify/restart the background service; also implied automatically by a non-default `--dest`), `--uninstall`, `--yes`, `--purge`.

### Windows One-Liner (PowerShell)

```powershell
iwr -useb "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail_rust/main/install.ps1?$(Get-Random)" | iex
```

PowerShell options: `-Version vX.Y.Z`, `-Dest PATH`, `-Force`.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail_rust
cd mcp_agent_mail_rust
./install-local.sh          # builds release, installs to ~/.local/bin
# DEST=/usr/local/bin ./install-local.sh   # custom destination
```

The script resolves the correct Cargo target directory via `cargo metadata`, so the
installed binary always matches the freshly-built artifact regardless of
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` overrides or workspace settings. Do **not** manually copy from
`target/release/am` -- if `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is set, that path may be stale.

Requires Rust nightly (see `rust-toolchain.toml`). Source builds also expect sibling checkouts in the parent directory for **two** repos: [`../frankensearch`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch) (a path dependency; its workspace also needs [`../fast_cmaes`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/fast_cmaes) for workspace-wide `cargo metadata`) and [`../beads_rust`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) on `main` (path-patched until a 0.4.x release lands on crates.io). Everything else -- asupersync, fastmcp, SQLmodel, FrankenSQLite, FrankenTUI, franken-agent-detection, tru, and rich_rust -- resolves from crates.io.

### Platforms

| Platform | Architecture | Binary |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Linux | x86_64 | `mcp-agent-mail-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| Linux | aarch64 | `mcp-agent-mail-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` |

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the server

```bash
am
```

Auto-detects all installed coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, OMP, etc.), refreshes their MCP connections as needed, and starts the HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:8765` with the interactive TUI.

### 2. Agents register and coordinate

Once the server is running, agents use MCP tools to coordinate:

Terminology note: `ensure_project` takes a `human_key`, which must be the absolute repo path. Most follow-on tools take `project_key`, which can be that same absolute path or the project's computed slug.

```
# Register identity
ensure_project(human_key="/abs/path/to/repo")
register_agent(project_key="/abs/path/to/repo", program="claude-code", model="opus-4.6")

# Reserve files before editing
file_reservation_paths(project_key="/abs/path/to/repo", agent_name="GreenCastle", paths=["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)

# Send a message
send_message(project_key="/abs/path/to/repo", sender_name="GreenCastle", to=["BlueLake"],
             subject="Starting auth refactor", body_md="Taking src/auth/**",
             thread_id="FEAT-123", ack_required=true)

# Check inbox
fetch_inbox(project_key="/abs/path/to/repo", agent_name="BlueLake")
acknowledge_message(project_key="/abs/path/to/repo", agent_name="BlueLake", message_id=123)
```

### 3. Use macros for common flows

```
# Boot a full session (ensure project + register agent + reserve files + fetch inbox)
macro_start_session(human_key="/abs/path/to/repo", program="claude-code", model="opus-4.6")

# Prepare for a thread (fetch context + recent messages)
macro_prepare_thread(project_key="/abs/path/to/repo", thread_id="FEAT-123",
                     program="claude-code", model="opus-4.6")

# Reserve, work, release cycle
macro_file_reservation_cycle(project_key="/abs/path/to/repo", agent_name="GreenCastle",
                             paths=["src/auth/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, auto_release=true)

# Contact handshake between agents in different projects
macro_contact_handshake(project_key="/abs/path/to/repo", requester="GreenCastle",
                        target="BlueLake", to_project="/abs/path/to/other/repo",
                        auto_accept=true, welcome_subject="Coordination channel",
                        welcome_body="Use thread FEAT-123 for the cutover")
```

## Agent Configuration

The installer and `am` command auto-detect installed agents and write their configs in HTTP URL mode. The examples below are the manual fallback.

### Claude Code

Add to your project's `.mcp.json` or `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-mail": {
      "command": "mcp-agent-mail",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

Or for HTTP transport (when the server is already running):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-mail": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/"
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex CLI

The curl installer writes this automatically for detected Codex CLI installs. For source installs, manual setup, or custom endpoint overrides, add this to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.mcp_agent_mail]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/"
# Add this when HTTP bearer auth is enabled:
http_headers = { Authorization = "Bearer <HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN>" }
```

### Gemini CLI

Add to `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-mail": {
      "command": "mcp-agent-mail",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

For a project-local Gemini setup plus Agent Mail identity registration:

```bash
scripts/register_gemini.sh /abs/path/to/repo
AGENT_NAME=BlueLake AGENT_MODEL=gemini-2.5-pro scripts/register_gemini.sh /abs/path/to/repo
```

### Oh My Pi (OMP)

`am setup run --agent omp` writes OMP's native project config at `.omp/mcp.json`
and the active profile's user config. The default profile uses
`~/.omp/agent/mcp.json`; named profiles selected through `OMP_PROFILE` (or the
legacy `PI_PROFILE`) use `~/.omp/profiles/<name>/agent/mcp.json`. Profile names
must use OMP's lowercase `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]{0,63}` syntax. Setup also
honors OMP's `PI_CONFIG_DIR` and default-profile `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`
overrides. The project config is profile-independent and applies under every
named OMP profile. To configure it manually:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-agent-mail": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/"
    }
  }
}
```

When HTTP bearer authentication is enabled, add an `Authorization` entry under
`headers`; `am setup run` does this automatically and adds `.omp/mcp.json` to
the project `.gitignore` so the credential is not committed.

### Any MCP-Compatible Client

Agent Mail supports both stdio and HTTP transports:

- **stdio**: Run `mcp-agent-mail` as a subprocess (the default for most MCP clients)
- **HTTP**: Connect to `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/` when the server is running via `am` or `mcp-agent-mail serve`
- **Examples**: Token-free client templates live under `docs/examples/mcp/`

---

## Server Modes

### MCP Server (default)

```bash
mcp-agent-mail                          # stdio transport (for MCP client integration)
mcp-agent-mail serve                    # HTTP server with TUI (default 127.0.0.1:8765)
mcp-agent-mail serve --no-tui           # Headless server (CI/daemon mode)
mcp-agent-mail serve --reuse-running    # Reuse existing server on same port
```

### CLI Operator Tool

```bash
am                                      # Auto-detect agents, refresh MCP config, start server + TUI
am serve-http --port 9000               # Different port
am serve-http --host 0.0.0.0            # Bind to all interfaces
am serve-http --no-auth                 # Skip authentication (local dev)
am serve-http --path api                # Use /api/ transport instead of /mcp/
am --help                               # Full operator CLI
```

When an interactive `am` finds a healthy Agent Mail service already serving the
configured endpoint, it attaches a read-only terminal view to that service's
`/mail/ws-state` snapshot. It does not stop or restart the service, acquire a
mutation lock, or run service-control commands. `--takeover` remains the
explicit opt-in for a local replacement.

### Dual-Mode Interface

This project keeps MCP server and CLI command surfaces separate:

| Use case | Entry point | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| MCP server (default) | `mcp-agent-mail` | Default: MCP stdio transport. HTTP: `serve`. |
| CLI (operator + agent-first) | `am` | Recommended CLI entry point. |
| CLI via single binary | `AM_INTERFACE_MODE=cli mcp-agent-mail` | Same CLI surface, one binary. |

Running CLI-only commands via the MCP binary produces a deterministic denial on stderr with exit code `2`, and vice versa, preventing accidental mode confusion in automated workflows.

---

## Operator CLI Surface

`am` is more than a launcher. It is the operator surface for runtime control, diagnostics, migration, exports, benchmarking, and agent-facing non-interactive workflows. In non-interactive contexts, bare `am` automatically falls back to robot output instead of trying to launch a blocking TUI.

### Command Families

| Surface | Subcommands / form | What it is for |
|---------|--------------------|----------------|
| Runtime | `serve-http`, `serve-stdio`, `service install|status|logs|restart`, `check-inbox`, `inbox-events` | Start the server, run stdio MCP, manage a background service, poll inbox state, or resume a durable inbox monitor |
| Quality gates | `ci`, `verify`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `bench` | Run the native quality pipeline, build-slot-protected verification lanes, and CLI/perf baselines |
| E2E and determinism | `e2e list|run|show`, `golden capture|verify|list`, `flake-triage scan|reproduce|detect` | Test transports and workflows, guard CLI output contracts, and triage flaky failures |
| Share and deploy | `share export|update|preview|verify|decrypt|wizard|static-export`, `share deploy validate|tooling|verify|verify-live` | Build portable mailbox bundles, preview them, and validate live static deployments |
| Archive and recovery | `archive save|list|restore`, `doctor check|archive-scan|archive-normalize|repair|backups|restore|reconstruct|fix` | Snapshot mailbox state, scan/archive hygiene, normalize safe archive debt, or repair/rebuild SQLite from the Git archive |
| Coordination data | `agents ...`, `mail ...`, `contacts ...`, `macros ...`, `file_reservations ...`, `acks ...`, `list-acks` | Operate directly on the same concepts the MCP tools expose |
| Project and product routing | `projects ...`, `products ...`, `list-projects`, `beads ...` | Manage project identity, cross-project product groupings, and task-tracker views |
| Platform and setup | `setup run|status`, `config set-port|show-port`, `amctl env`, `tooling ...`, `docs insert-blurbs` | Bootstrap connectors, inspect runtime config, introspect tool schemas/metrics/locks, and stamp docs |
| Migration and lifecycle | `legacy detect|import|status`, `upgrade`, `migrate`, `self-update`, `am-run`, `guard ...` | Migrate Python installs, perform DB-format upgrades, run slot-aware build commands, and manage guard hooks |
| Break-glass admin | `clear-and-reset-everything` | Fully reset local state after optional archival. Use sparingly. |

### Setup Drift Reports

`am setup status` is read-only. It inventories supported MCP clients, reports the
current redacted server entry beside the expected entry, and labels drift such
as `missing_file`, `legacy_stdio`, `stale_http_path`, `wrong_bearer_header`,
`wrong_startup_timeout`, `duplicate_server_entries`, and `unsupported_config`.

Use the reported remediation in two steps:

```bash
am setup status --format json
am setup run --dry-run --project-dir "$PWD" --format toon
am setup run --yes --project-dir "$PWD" --format toon
```

For bearer-header checks, pass `--token` to `am setup status` or expose the
expected token through `HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN` / `config.env`; status output redacts
token values.

### Durable Inbox Event Cursors

`am inbox-events` is the CLI for restart-safe inbox monitors. It reads
append-only, body-free delivery events oldest first; its `--after` value is a
delivery cursor, never a message ID. Persist `next_cursor` only after the
corresponding events have been processed.

```bash
# Establish a durable starting position without consuming events.
am inbox-events --project /abs/path --agent BlueLake --position-now --format json

# Resume from the last processed delivery cursor.
am inbox-events --project /abs/path --agent BlueLake --after 42 --limit 100 --format json
```

Each page includes `events`, `next_cursor`, `has_more`,
`oldest_available_cursor`, and `tail_cursor`. A cursor below retained history
returns `CURSOR_EXPIRED`; a cursor beyond the tail returns `CURSOR_AHEAD`.

## The 48 MCP Tools

### 9 Clusters

| Cluster | Count | Tools |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Infrastructure | 4 | `health_check`, `ensure_project`, `install_precommit_guard`, `uninstall_precommit_guard` |
| Identity | 11 | `register_agent`, `create_agent_identity`, `deregister_agent`, `retire_agent`, `unretire_agent`, `sweep_stale_agents`, `list_window_identities`, `whois`, `resolve_pane_identity`, `cleanup_pane_identities`, `list_agents` |
| Messaging | 8 | `send_message`, `reply_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `fetch_topic`, `fetch_inbox_events`, `get_message_delivery_receipt`, `acknowledge_message`, `mark_message_read` |
| Contacts | 4 | `request_contact`, `respond_contact`, `list_contacts`, `set_contact_policy` |
| File Reservations | 5 | `check_file_reservation_conflicts`, `file_reservation_paths`, `renew_file_reservations`, `release_file_reservations`, `force_release_file_reservation` |
| Search | 4 | `search_messages`, `summarize_thread`, `summarize_recent`, `fetch_summary` |
| Macros | 4 | `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_contact_handshake`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle` |
| Product Bus | 5 | `ensure_product`, `products_link`, `search_messages_product`, `fetch_inbox_product`, `summarize_thread_product` |
| Build Slots | 3 | `acquire_build_slot`, `renew_build_slot`, `release_build_slot` |

`fetch_inbox_events` is the MCP equivalent of `am inbox-events`: it is a
durable, recipient-scoped delivery feed for monitors, not a replacement for
message-body inbox reads.

`file_reservation_paths` accepts an optional `idempotency_key` for an exact
retry after a timeout. The same key and normalized request replay the original
grant without a second lease or archive write and mark the response
`idempotent_replay: true`. Reusing a key with different arguments returns
`IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_CONFLICT`. Keys are scoped to `(project, tool)`, expire after
the configured retention window, and are optional; this is not a blanket
idempotency claim for every mutating tool.

### 25 MCP Resources

Read-only resources span environment/config inspection, project and agent discovery, inbox and thread views, reservation views, and tooling diagnostics. They are there so agents can fetch state cheaply without mutating anything.

```
resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20
resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true
resource://mailbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>
resource://views/ack-overdue/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>
resource://agents/<project-slug>
resource://file_reservations/<project-slug>?active_only=true
resource://tooling/metrics
resource://config/environment
```

`resource://agents/...` and `resource://file_reservations/...` take the project in the path segment. Inbox, mailbox, thread, and message resources put the agent or thread in the path and the project in the query string.

### Macros vs. Granular Tools

- **Prefer macros when you want speed** or are on a smaller model: `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`
- **Use granular tools when you need control:** `register_agent`, `file_reservation_paths`, `send_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `acknowledge_message`

## TUI Operations Console

The interactive TUI has 16 screens. Jump directly with `1`-`9`, `0` (screen 10), and shifted digits `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `^` (screens 11-16). Use `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` to cycle in order.

| # | Screen | Shows |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | Dashboard | Real-time operational overview with event stream and anomaly rail |
| 2 | Messages | Message browser with detail pane, presets, and compose/reply flows |
| 3 | Threads | Thread explorer and conversation drill-down |
| 4 | Agents | Agent roster with activity, state, and quick actions |
| 5 | Search | Unified multi-scope search with facets and preview |
| 6 | Reservations | File reservation status, conflicts, and create/release actions |
| 7 | Tool Metrics | Per-tool call counts, latency distributions, and failures |
| 8 | System Health | Probe/circuit/disk/memory diagnostics plus ATC health widget |
| 9 | Timeline | Events/Commits/Combined timeline views with inspector |
| 10 | Projects | Project inventory and routing helpers |
| 11 | Contacts | Contact links, policy view, and graph/mermaid modes |
| 12 | Explorer | Unified inbox/outbox explorer with direction and ack filters |
| 13 | Analytics | Anomaly insight feed with confidence and deep links |
| 14 | Attachments | Attachment inventory with preview and provenance |
| 15 | Archive Browser | Two-pane Git archive browser with tree + file preview |
| 16 | ATC | Snapshot-driven ATC control surface with decision drill-in and retention report |

**Global keys:** `?` help, `Ctrl+P`/`:` command palette, `/` global search focus, `.` contextual action menu, `Ctrl+N` compose overlay, `Ctrl+Y` toast-focus mode, `Ctrl+T`/`Shift+T` cycle theme, `m` toggle MCP/API transport, `q` quit.
**ATC keys:** `d` decision detail, `r` retention report, `i` toggle detail pane, `Tab` switch agents/decisions.

**Screen-specific highlights:** Messages uses `g` for Local/Global inbox; Threads uses `e/c` for expand/collapse-all in conversation view; Timeline uses `V` for Events/Commits/Combined and `v` for visual selection; Search uses `f` + facet rail navigation for scope/sort/field controls; Contacts uses `n` for Table/Graph mode; batch-capable screens share `Space`/`v`/`A`/`C`; preset-enabled screens use `Ctrl+S`/`Ctrl+L`.

**Command palette:** Press `Ctrl+P` (or `:` outside text-entry) to open a searchable action launcher that includes screen navigation, transport/layout controls, and dynamic entities (agents/projects/threads/tools/reservations).

**Themes:** Cyberpunk Aurora, Darcula, Lumen Light, Nordic Frost, High Contrast. Accessibility support includes high-contrast mode and reduced motion.
Archive Browser note: use `Enter` to expand/preview, `Tab` to switch tree vs preview pane, `/` to filter filenames, and `Ctrl+D/U` for preview paging.

If an interactive `am` attaches to an already running service, this terminal is
read-only and detaches with `Ctrl-C`; the service keeps serving MCP/API traffic.
Use an explicit `--takeover` only when replacement is intended.

---

## Robot Mode (`am robot`)

Non-interactive, agent-first CLI surface for TUI-equivalent situational awareness. Use it when you need structured snapshots quickly, especially in automated loops and when tokens matter.

### 18 Subcommands

| Command | Purpose | Key flags |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `am robot status` | Dashboard synthesis | `--format`, `--project`, `--agent` |
| `am robot inbox` | Actionable inbox with urgency/ack synthesis | `--urgent`, `--ack-overdue`, `--unread`, `--all`, `--limit`, `--include-bodies` |
| `am robot timeline` | Event stream since last check | `--since`, `--kind`, `--source` |
| `am robot overview` | Cross-project summary | `--format`, `--project`, `--agent` |
| `am robot thread <id>` | Full thread rendering | `--limit`, `--since`, `--format` |
| `am robot search <query>` | Full-text search with facets/relevance | `--kind`, `--importance`, `--since`, `--format` |
| `am robot message <id>` | Single-message deep view | `--format`, `--project`, `--agent` |
| `am robot navigate <resource://...>` | Resolve resources into robot-formatted output | `--format`, `--project`, `--agent` |
| `am robot reservations` | Reservation view with conflict/expiry awareness | `--all`, `--conflicts`, `--expiring`, `--agent` |
| `am robot metrics` | Tool call rates, failures, latency percentiles | `--format`, `--project`, `--agent` |
| `am robot health` | Runtime/system diagnostics | `--format`, `--project`, `--agent`, `--include-host` |
| `am robot analytics` | Anomaly and remediation summary | `--format`, `--project`, `--agent` |
| `am robot agents` | Agent roster and activity overview | `--active`, `--sort` |
| `am robot contacts` | Contact graph and policy surface | `--format`, `--project`, `--agent` |
| `am robot projects` | Per-project aggregate stats | `--format`, `--project`, `--agent` |
| `am robot attachments` | Attachment inventory and provenance | `--format`, `--project`, `--agent` |
| `am robot atc` | Live ATC snapshot with local DB fallback when the server is unavailable | `--since`, `--stratum`, `--summary-only`, `--limit` |
| `am robot handoff` | Read-only stale bead ownership and handoff dashboard | `--stale-minutes`, `--active-minutes`, `--fresh-comment-minutes`, `--include-fresh`, `--dry-run` |

### Output Formats

- **`toon`** (default at TTY): Token-efficient, compact, optimized for agent parsing
- **`json`** (default when piped): Machine-readable envelope with `_meta`, `_alerts`, `_actions`
- **`md`** (thread/message-focused): Human-readable narrative for deep context

`am robot atc` reads the live ATC snapshot over `/mail/ws-state` when the local server is running and falls back to a local SQLite rollup/liveness view when that snapshot is unavailable. Use `--since` to trim recent decisions/executions, `--stratum` to focus open-stratum counts, and `--summary-only` for the compact health view.

`am robot handoff` correlates in-progress beads with Agent Mail activity, active file reservations, thread mail, and recent comments. It is always read-only: reopen/takeover rows contain proposed `br update ... --status open --json` commands, but agents must inspect reservations, peer dirty work, and the related thread before running them.

### Agent Workflow Recipes

```bash
# Startup triage
am robot status --project /abs/path --agent AgentName

# Immediate urgency pass
am robot inbox --project /abs/path --agent AgentName --urgent --format json

# Incremental monitoring loop
am robot timeline --project /abs/path --agent AgentName --since 2026-02-16T10:00:00Z

# Deep thread drill-down
am robot thread br-123 --project /abs/path --agent AgentName --format md

# Reservation safety check before edits
am robot reservations --project /abs/path --agent AgentName --conflicts --expiring 30

# Heavy verification recommendation with build-slot admission and rch
am robot status --project /abs/path --agent AgentName --format json \
  | jq '.recommendations[] | select(.category == "verification_lane")'
```

## File Reservations for Multi-Agent Editing

Before editing, agents reserve file paths to avoid conflicts:

```
file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, paths=["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)
```

The pre-commit guard (`mcp-agent-mail-guard`) installs as a Git hook and blocks commits that touch files reserved by other agents. Reservations are advisory, TTL-based, and support glob patterns.

New reservation artifacts are named
`id-<reservation-id>-g<db-generation>.json` and carry the same generation in
their JSON. This prevents a re-created SQLite database from overwriting an
older generation's row-id artifact. Readers still recognize legacy
`id-<reservation-id>.json` artifacts; parity reports stamped artifacts from a
different live generation as foreign-generation debris rather than current
reservation drift.

The guard has narrow operational exemptions: `.beads/**` metadata is always
exempt so shared task-state commits cannot be stranded, and an agent's own
reservation does not conflict with its commit. Source files reserved by another
agent remain protected. When no matching mailbox archive can be found (including
a proven slug collision), the hook emits a warning and allows the commit rather
than turning stale/missing mailbox state into a universal commit gate.

| Area | Reserve glob |
|------|-------------|
| Core types/config | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-core/src/**` |
| SQLite layer | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-db/src/**` |
| Git archive | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/**` |
| Tool implementations | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-tools/src/**` |
| TUI | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/tui_*.rs` |
| CLI/launcher | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-cli/src/**` |

    S-->>A: released ✓
```

### Same Repository

1. **Register identity:** `ensure_project(human_key=<abs-path>)` + `register_agent(project_key=<abs-path>, ...)`
2. **Reserve files before editing:** `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, paths=["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)`
3. **Communicate with threads:** `send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")`, check with `fetch_inbox`, acknowledge with `acknowledge_message`
4. **Quick reads:** `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20`

### Across Different Repos

- **Option A (single project bus):** Register both repos under the same `project_key`. Keep reservation patterns specific (`frontend/**` vs `backend/**`).
- **Option B (separate projects):** Each repo has its own `project_key`. Use `macro_contact_handshake` to link agents, then message directly. Keep a shared `thread_id` across repos.

### External Git Coordination (opt-in)

`mcp-agent-mail` serializes its own in-process git shell-outs via
per-repo `flock` on `<repo>/.git/am.git-serialize.lock`. External tools
(wrapper scripts, editor integrations, CI) can honor the same sentinel
by invoking git through `scripts/git-with-amlock.sh`:

```bash
# one-time: put the wrapper on PATH
install -m755 scripts/git-with-amlock.sh ~/.local/bin/git-with-amlock

# per-shell: resolve an "am-aware" git for automation
export GIT_BIN="$(command -v git-with-amlock || command -v git)"
alias gitam='"$GIT_BIN"'

# your automation invokes gitam instead of git:
gitam status
gitam commit -m 'synced'
```

**Scope of the mitigation:**

- mcp-agent-mail's own in-process calls → always coordinated
  (automatic).
- External tools that opt into the wrapper → coordinated.
- Your IDE running `git commit` directly, with no wrapper →
  **still races**. The only complete mitigation for that case is to
  set `AM_GIT_BINARY` to a safe git binary, or upgrade/downgrade the
  system git. See the
  [Known-bad git versions](#known-bad-git-versions) section.

The wrapper honors `AM_GIT_BINARY` for binary selection and
`AM_GIT_FLOCK_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 60s) for the bounded wait cap.
Exit code 75 (`EX_TEMPFAIL`) signals a flock timeout.

### With Beads Task Tracking

Agent Mail pairs with [Beads](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (`br`) for dependency-aware task selection:

1. **Pick ready work:** `br ready --json` (choose highest priority, no blockers)
2. **Reserve edit surface:** `file_reservation_paths(..., reason="br-123")`
3. **Announce start:** `send_message(..., thread_id="br-123", subject="[br-123] Start: <title>", ack_required=true)`
4. **Work and update:** Reply in-thread with progress
5. **Complete and release:** `br close 123`, `release_file_reservations(...)`, final Mail reply

Use the Beads issue ID (`br-123`) as the Mail `thread_id` and prefix message subjects with `[br-123]` to keep everything linked.

## Web UI

The server includes a lightweight, server-rendered web UI for humans at `/mail/`. Agents should continue using MCP tools and resources; the web UI is for human review and oversight. Use `/mail/*` for mailbox and task oversight. The authenticated live browser TUI mirror at `/web-dashboard` remains deferred and is not a supported surface.

The project website separately embeds the real production `DashboardScreen` through
`crates/mcp-agent-mail-dashboard-wasm/` and FrankenTUI's browser renderer. That surface
is an interactive, read-only public replay: six SQLite aggregate counts are real, while
all names, paths, messages, and replay events are synthetic. It does not connect to a
visitor's mailbox or expose the deferred `/mail/ws-input` path. The deterministic opening
frame carries 192 synthetic history events, 500 agent rows, 41 project rows, and 200
contact rows so the production dashboard opens at the same busy visual density as a real
operator session without publishing mailbox content. See
[`docs/SPEC-browser-parity-contract-deferred.md`](docs/SPEC-browser-parity-contract-deferred.md)
for the shipped replay boundary and the still-deferred live parity contract.

### Routes

| Route | What You See |
|-------|-------------|
| `/mail/` and `/mail/unified-inbox` | Unified inbox across all projects with importance filtering and related-project context |

### Human Overseer

Sometimes you need to redirect agents mid-session. The **Overseer** compose form at `/mail/{project}/overseer/compose` lets humans send high-priority messages directly to any combination of agents.

Overseer messages:

- Come from a special `HumanOverseer` agent (program: `WebUI`, model: `Human`)
- Are always marked **high importance** so they stand out in agent inboxes
- Bypass normal contact policies so you can always reach any agent
- Include a preamble instructing agents to pause current work, handle the request, then resume

Agents see overseer messages in their normal inbox via `fetch_inbox` or `resource://inbox/{name}?project=<abs-path>`. They can reply in-thread like any other message. Everything is stored identically to agent-to-agent messages (Git + SQLite), fully auditable.

## Deployment Validation

```bash
# Export a bundle
am share export -o /tmp/agent-mail-bundle --no-zip

# Verify a live deployment against the bundle
am share deploy verify-live https://example.github.io/agent-mail \
  --bundle /tmp/agent-mail-bundle \
  --json > /tmp/verify-live.json

# Inspect verdict
jq '.verdict, .summary, .config' /tmp/verify-live.json
```

Exit codes: `0` = pass, `1` = fail.

## Configuration

All configuration via environment variables. The server reads them at startup via `Config::from_env()`.

### Registration Proof Gate (optional, off by default)

By default Agent Mail uses a **self-asserted** identity model: any caller may
`register_agent` under any well-formed name. That is the right trade-off for
local, trusted, single-operator multi-agent coordination and remains the
default — nothing changes unless you opt in.

Deployments where agents come from **different operators or less-trusted
sources** can require a cryptographic proof before any identity is persisted.
When enabled, `register_agent` (and every other path that can implicitly
create an agent row, including `send_message` / `request_contact`
auto-registration and the CLI) demands a `registration_proof` argument: a JSON
bundle binding the final agent name, project key, program, model, capability
scope, an `issued_at`/`expires_at` window, and a single-use nonce, signed
(Ed25519) by one of your configured trust anchors. Verification is
**fail-closed**: a missing, malformed, untrusted, expired, replayed, or
mismatched proof rejects the registration and writes nothing. Consumed nonces
are persisted in the database, so replay protection survives server restarts.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AM_REGISTRATION_PROOF_GATE_ENABLED` | `false` | Master switch. Off = self-asserted identity (unchanged default). |
| `AM_REGISTRATION_PROOF_TRUSTED_KEYS` | (empty) | Comma-separated base64 Ed25519 public keys (32 raw bytes each). Enabled with no keys = every registration fails closed. |
| `AM_REGISTRATION_PROOF_MAX_LIFETIME_SECONDS` | `300` | Maximum allowed `expires_at - issued_at` window. |
| `AM_REGISTRATION_PROOF_CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS` | `60` | Clock-skew tolerance for the validity window. |
| `AM_REGISTRATION_PROOF_REQUIRE_NONCE` | `true` | Require and consume a single-use nonce per proof (replay protection). |

The canonical signing bytes are explicit (domain-separation tag +
newline-delimited `field=value` lines; capabilities sorted and de-duplicated),
so issuers can be written in any language. Verification is expressed through a
pluggable `ProofVerifier` trait (`crates/mcp-agent-mail-tools/src/proof_gate.rs`);
the shipped implementation is the Ed25519 trust-anchor verifier, and external
verifier backends can be added without touching registration call sites.

### Canonical File Layout

The runtime uses several paths whose defaults have evolved across versions.
This table resolves the three-way ambiguity:

| Path | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `~/.mcp_agent_mail_git_mailbox_repo/` | Legacy archive root (pre-v1) | No longer created; honored if it already exists on disk |
| `$XDG_DATA_HOME/mcp-agent-mail/git_mailbox_repo/` | Current archive root (`STORAGE_ROOT` default) | `~/.local/share/mcp-agent-mail/git_mailbox_repo/` on most Linux systems |
| `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mcp-agent-mail/config.env` | Canonical env file (installer writes here) | `~/.config/mcp-agent-mail/config.env` on most Linux systems |
| `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mcp-agent-mail/.env` | Compatibility env file | Checked when `config.env` is absent |
| `~/.mcp_agent_mail/.env` | Legacy env file | Checked after XDG paths |
| `./storage.sqlite3` | Runtime database (`DATABASE_URL` default) | Relative to working directory, or absolute if configured |

The `STORAGE_ROOT` resolution logic: if the legacy path `~/.mcp_agent_mail_git_mailbox_repo/`
exists on disk, it is used for backward compatibility. Otherwise the XDG data
directory is preferred. Override with `STORAGE_ROOT=/your/path` in the environment.

### Storage Layout (inside STORAGE_ROOT)

```
$STORAGE_ROOT/                              # e.g. ~/.local/share/mcp-agent-mail/git_mailbox_repo/
├── projects/
│   └── {project_slug}/
│       ├── .git/                           # Per-project git repository
│       ├── messages/
│       │   └── {YYYY}/{MM}/               # Date-partitioned canonical messages
│       ├── agents/
│       │   └── {agent_name}/
│       │       ├── inbox/                  # Agent inbox copies
│       │       └── outbox/                 # Agent outbox copies
│       ├── build_slots/                    # Build slot leases (JSON)
│       └── file_reservations/              # Reservation artifacts
└── .archive.lock                           # Global advisory lock
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Git-backed archive** for human auditability; SQLite as fast index
- **WAL mode** with PRAGMA tuning and connection pooling for concurrent access
- **Write-behind cache** with dual-indexed ReadCache and deferred touch batching (30s flush)
- **Async git commit coalescer** (write-behind queue) to avoid commit storms
- **i64 microseconds** for all timestamps (no `chrono::NaiveDateTime` in storage layer)
- **Search V3 via frankensearch**: lexical tier ships by default in the supported search stack; semantic and hybrid fusion are compiled through the `feature = "hybrid"` gate, with portable/no-default builds retaining the deterministic lexical path.
- **Conformance testing** against the Python reference implementation plus Rust-native extensions
- **Advisory file reservations** with symmetric fnmatch, archive reading, and rename handling
- **`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`** across all crates
- **Query-only read lane** — direct mailbox reads use an existing live SQLite pool and do not wait for archive reconstruction or write-behind coalescing
- **Evidence-bearing timeouts** — timeout responses and health output expose the measured stage and latency evidence instead of assigning generic database blame
- **asupersync exclusively** for all async operations (no Tokio, reqwest, hyper, or axum)

## ATC Learning Implementation Map

> **Validated ATC learning loop — rollout remains gated by write mode.**
>
> ATC now has a durable live-learning path: hot-path `atc_note_*` hooks append experience rows, real runtime signals resolve outcomes, rollups/retention/replay are implemented, and robot/TUI surfaces consume the shared live operator snapshot. `AM_ATC_WRITE_MODE` still gates rollout (`off` default, `shadow` for observation, `live` for durable writes), so broader promotion remains operator-controlled rather than always-on. Treat the map below as the current ownership contract and rollout/hardening guide, not as a future-only blueprint.

The `br-0qt6e` ATC learning work is intentionally cross-cutting, but it should not be cross-owned. The codebase already has the right seams; future implementation should deepen those seams instead of spreading ATC state across tools, UI layers, or ad-hoc SQL in random crates.

### Ownership by crate and module

| Area | Current modules | Owns | Must not own |
|------|------------------|------|--------------|
| Core contract | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-core/src/experience.rs`, `evidence_ledger.rs`, `atc_baseline.rs`, `config.rs` | Canonical `ExperienceRow` shape, lifecycle transitions, feature vector/extension schema, decision/evidence identifiers, frozen pre-learning baseline, env/config surface | SQL persistence, archive writes, UI-specific formatting |
| SQLite persistence | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-db/src/schema.rs` (v16 `atc_experiences`, `atc_experience_rollups`) | Durable raw experience rows, open-resolution lookup indexes, stratum rollups, retention/compaction mechanics, future insert/resolve/query APIs | Decision policy, ATC tick logic, web/TUI rendering |
| Git/archive boundary | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-storage/src/lib.rs` | Human-auditable artifact writes, WBQ/commit coalescing, selected policy/audit artifacts when explicitly promoted | Raw ATC experience exhaust; the current `WriteOp` surface intentionally handles message, reservation, profile, and notification artifacts, not learning-row mirroring |
| ATC runtime | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/atc.rs` | Decision engine, liveness/conflict/routing/calibration math, policy bundle loading, global ATC singletons, tick loop, outcome feedback, summary snapshots | Direct SQLite schema ownership, long-lived CLI state, alternate UI-specific models |
| Runtime wiring | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/lib.rs` | Bootstrapping via `init_global_atc()` and `start_atc_operator_runtime()`, tool-dispatch liveness hooks via `atc_register_agent_with_project()` and `atc_observe_activity_with_project()`, shared ATC operator snapshot publication | Per-tool bespoke learning persistence; tool handlers should emit domain facts, not become the learning store |
| Agent/operator surfaces | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-cli/src/robot.rs`, `crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/tui_screens/system_health.rs`, `tui_web_dashboard.rs`, `/mail/ws-state` | Rendering the shared ATC/operator snapshot for robot and live TUI consumers; reserved browser-mirror modules stay read-only/non-owning and fall back to local heuristics only when live server state is unavailable | Independent ATC truth, separate persistence, or duplicate learning logic |
| Tool/resource layer | `crates/mcp-agent-mail-tools/src/*`, `crates/mcp-agent-mail-tools/src/resources.rs` | Normal tool/resource contracts for mailbox coordination; ATC-adjacent work should surface through existing runtime hooks and shared snapshots | Owning ATC learning state machines or experience-row lifecycle rules |

### Append and resolution hooks

- Session/bootstrap and liveness hooks already land at the server dispatch boundary: successful `register_agent` and `macro_start_session` calls register agents with ATC, and tool execution updates ATC activity timestamps.
- The durable append path now belongs in that same server/runtime seam, not inside individual UIs. Message and reservation learning hooks flow from the tool-result/event boundary in `mcp-agent-mail-server/src/lib.rs` into the ATC-facing note functions in `mcp-agent-mail-server/src/atc.rs`: `atc_note_message_sent()`, `atc_note_message_received()`, `atc_note_reservation_granted()`, `atc_note_reservation_released()`, and `atc_note_reservation_conflicts()`.
- Outcome resolution now flows through the server ATC runtime via `atc_record_outcome()` and the overdue/retention sweeps, with the DB crate owning the actual row mutation and rollup updates.
- `/mail/ws-state` polling, `am robot atc`, the ATC TUI screen, and the System Health screen stay snapshot-driven consumers of `atc_operator_snapshot()` / `atc_summary()`, not alternate sources of learning state. The deferred `/web-dashboard/*` browser mirror is intentionally outside the supported live ATC surface today.

### Hot path vs. cold path boundaries

- Hot path: `mcp-agent-mail-server/src/atc.rs`, the tool-dispatch hook in `mcp-agent-mail-server/src/lib.rs`, and the DB append/resolve calls behind `AM_ATC_WRITE_MODE`. This path must stay append-friendly, bounded, and free of Git write amplification.
- Warm path: ATC operator snapshots, `/mail/ws-state` polling, `am robot atc`, and the TUI/System Health surfaces. These consumers should read already-computed ATC state and only fall back to local heuristics when the live server snapshot is unavailable. The deferred `/web-dashboard/*` mirror is intentionally excluded from the live warm path until a future resurrection effort lands.
- Cold path: promoted policy bundles, transparency cards, replay artifacts, and operator-facing audit bundles. These may be written through `mcp-agent-mail-storage`, but only after they are intentionally compacted and selected.
- Explicit non-owner boundary: `mcp-agent-mail-search-core`, share/export, and the WASM/browser mirror are consumers or transport layers. They should not become the canonical home of ATC learning policy, persistence, or attribution logic.

### Verification ownership

- `crates/mcp-agent-mail-core/src/experience.rs`: unit/property coverage for lifecycle validity, feature-vector stability, serialization, and idempotent resolution transitions.
- `crates/mcp-agent-mail-db/src/schema.rs` plus the ATC DB query modules: migration coverage, insert/resolve semantics, rollup correctness, retention/compaction tests, and replay/reconstruct safety.
- `crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/atc.rs`: decision math, policy-bundle loading, safe-mode transitions, tick budgeting, and feedback/calibration tests.
- `crates/mcp-agent-mail-server/src/lib.rs`, `tui_ws_state.rs`, `tui_screens/system_health.rs`, and `crates/mcp-agent-mail-cli/src/robot.rs`: snapshot publication, route contracts, robot fallback behavior, and operator-surface rendering tests.
- `tests/e2e/` and performance harnesses: live-server E2E plus soak/perf coverage validate that ATC learning stays low-write-amplification and does not regress request/tick budgets.

### Rollout and hardening priorities

1. Keep `mcp-agent-mail-core` as the schema-and-policy contract so experience/evidence/config changes stay centralized and reviewable.
2. Preserve `mcp-agent-mail-db` as the only durable ATC mutation/query surface for append, resolve, rollup, retention, and replay behavior.
3. Continue routing real runtime events through `atc_note_*` and `atc_record_outcome()` instead of duplicating learning logic in tools, UIs, or ad-hoc SQL paths.
4. Keep robot, TUI, and browser/dashboard surfaces snapshot-driven consumers of `atc_operator_snapshot()` rather than alternate sources of ATC truth.
5. Land remaining rollout/default-flip, data-minimization, and operator-hardening work on top of the existing live path rather than reopening seam ownership questions.

## Core Data Model

| Type | Role |
|------|------|
| `Project` | Stable identity for one codebase, keyed by absolute path and slug |
| `Product` | Cross-project grouping for search, inbox aggregation, and routing |
| `Agent` | Registered worker identity with name, program, model, policy, and task metadata |
| `Message` | Canonical envelope for subject, body, importance, thread, attachments, and recipients |
| `Recipient` | Delivery metadata for `to`/`cc`/`bcc`, read state, and acknowledgement state |
| `Thread` | Logical conversation identifier spanning replies and summaries |
| `FileReservation` | Advisory lease over file paths/globs with TTL, exclusivity, and reason |
| `BuildSlot` | Named lease used to serialize build-heavy work on a shared checkout |
| `ToolMetrics` | Per-tool latency, error, and call-count telemetry used by TUI, CLI, and diagnostics |

The important boundary is this: Git stores the durable human-auditable artifacts, while SQLite stores the queryable operational state. Every surface in the project is built around that split.

---

## How the System Works

### Write Path

1. An MCP tool call, CLI command, web overseer action, or guard hook enters the runtime.
2. Inputs are normalized and validated against project identity, agent names, and policy constraints.
3. The SQLite layer performs the indexed mutation: insert/update rows, enforce invariants, and emit IDs/timestamps.
4. The storage layer writes canonical Markdown/JSON artifacts into the per-project archive.
5. The commit coalescer batches archive updates so bursts of activity do not become commit storms.
6. Metrics and event streams are updated so TUI, robot, and web surfaces all observe the same fresh state.

### Read Path

1. A resource read, robot command, TUI view, or web request asks for mailbox or tooling state.
2. The server resolves scope: project, agent, product, thread, search query, or tooling view.
3. For direct state, an existing live SQLite mailbox answers through a query-only lane; it does not wait for archive reconstruction or the write-behind coalescer, and a read request does not create a missing project. `fetch_inbox` performs its optional read-receipt update separately after the bounded read. For search, Search V3 plans the query and executes the appropriate lexical route, or the semantic/hybrid route when the `feature = "hybrid"` build path is enabled.
4. The result is rendered as MCP JSON, robot `toon`/`json`/`md`, TUI widgets, or HTML under `/mail/`.

That consistency comes from a shared DB + archive + metrics pipeline. The TUI, web UI, robot CLI, and MCP resources are separate renderers over the same underlying state.

---

## Search Architecture

Search V3 is not an afterthought bolted onto mailbox rows. It is a dedicated query path with shared planning and diagnostics:

- Queries are normalized, classified, and routed through a unified search service.
- Lexical mode provides the baseline contract and diagnostics surface; semantic and hybrid modes extend that contract when the `hybrid` feature is enabled.
- Candidate budgeting and fusion keep broad natural-language queries from exploding while preserving exact-match strength for identifiers and short phrases.
- The same search path serves MCP tools, `am mail search`, `am robot search`, TUI search, and web UI search routes.
- Empty or non-searchable queries route through a deterministic SQL plan before Search V3 candidate retrieval. Legacy SQLite FTS artifacts still exist for migration hygiene and cleanup, but the current search architecture is Search V3 plus that deterministic SQL plan, not a hidden FTS fallback.

The dedicated `mcp-agent-mail-search-core` crate exists specifically so search planning and backends can evolve without entangling the rest of the mailbox stack.

## Coordination Algorithms and Safety Invariants

- **Explicit recipients only.** `send_message` keeps a `broadcast` field for schema compatibility, but `broadcast=true` is intentionally rejected so agents cannot spam every other agent by default.
- **Project isolation first.** Agent names are only meaningful inside a project unless a contact link or product bus path explicitly bridges them.
- **Symmetric reservation matching.** File reservation conflicts use symmetric glob overlap checks, so `src/**` conflicts with `src/lib.rs` in either direction.
- **TTL instead of forever-locks.** Reservations and build slots expire, which makes the system robust to crashed or vanished agents.
- **Wrong-surface denial.** MCP-only and CLI-only commands fail deterministically when invoked through the wrong entrypoint, reducing automation footguns.
- **Idempotent session bootstrapping.** `ensure_project`, `register_agent`, and the session macros are designed so agents can safely retry startup without creating duplicate identity state.
- **Durable monitor cursors.** Inbox-event consumers advance a recipient delivery cursor only after handling an oldest-first page; a message ID is never a safe cursor substitute.
- **Contact approval as policy, not convention.** Cross-project messaging is gated by explicit contact workflows and per-agent contact policies.

These are the design rules that let many agents share one checkout without immediately degenerating into chaos.

---

## Consistency and Recovery Model

- **SQLite is the live operational state.** MCP tools, resources, the TUI, the web UI, and robot/CLI reads use SQLite for current inboxes, message IDs, read/ack state, reservations, agents, products, and search planning.
- **Git is the durable artifact ledger.** Canonical messages, inbox/outbox copies, reservation files, and agent profiles are written as files under per-project archives so the mailbox remains human-auditable and recoverable.
- **Concurrent writes are queued, not hand-merged.** Parallel agents can send to the same thread at the same time; the server/DB layer serializes the indexed mutations, and the archive write-behind queue plus commit coalescer batches the corresponding Git artifact writes. There is no workflow where two agents create a Git merge conflict and a human resolver has to pick the winning message.
- **Reservation artifacts have a database generation.** A new physical SQLite database gets a new generation token, so its reservation row IDs cannot overwrite a prior generation's archive artifacts. Foreign stamped artifacts remain inspectable without being treated as live parity drift.
- **Repair is not reconstruct.** `am doctor repair` is the in-place hygiene path. `am doctor reconstruct` is the archive-first rebuild path when SQLite is no longer trustworthy.
- **Backups are first-class.** `archive save`, doctor backups, and restore flows all exist because operational recovery is part of the product, not a manual afterthought.
- **Stale lock cleanup is expected.** Guard hooks, archive lock management, and doctor checks assume agents crash and processes die unexpectedly.

If the live layer gets sick, the durable ledger can rebuild it.

`am verify` is a thin `am-run` lane mapper. It always shows the exact command, uses a `verify-*` build slot even when `WORKTREES_ENABLED` is not set in the shell, routes cargo-heavy work through `rch exec -- ...`, and writes `command.json`, `stdout.log`, `stderr.log`, `exit_code.txt`, and `result.json` under `STORAGE_ROOT/artifacts/verify/<timestamp>-<lane>/` unless `--artifact-dir` is supplied.

`result.json` includes `rch_proof.status`, `child_exit_code`, and the final proof `exit_code`. For `rch exec` lanes, a zero-exit child is only green when the captured output includes a positive remote-execution marker. Local fallback or missing remote proof fails closed, writes `rch_proof_failure.txt`, and best-effort captures `rch_status_workers.json` plus `rch_queue.json` so operators can distinguish a remote test failure from transport/sync/fleet degradation.

Release evidence for robot/doctor fields must prove the installed `am` binary, not only the source-built test binary. For parity-sensitive fields such as `forensic_timeline`, search-index health, recovery status, artifact links, next actions, and redaction, run the installed-binary parity gate against the release candidate installed on the same host or remote worker:

```bash
AM_INSTALLED_BINARY_PARITY_BIN=/path/to/installed/am \
  rch exec -- cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --test integration_runs \
  installed_binary_parity_probe_compares_source_and_installed_am -- --ignored --nocapture
```

The gate writes `tests/artifacts/installed_binary_parity/<run>/parity_report.json` with one pass/fail row per required JSON path, redacted source/installed values, value-mismatch status, and redacted command metadata. If the candidate lacks fields that source tests rely on, or returns different required values, the report is red and the release is not closed. A local direct `am doctor check --json` or `am robot ... --format json` probe is useful for quick inspection, but it is not sufficient release evidence unless paired with this parity report and an `rch exec -- ...` cargo proof.

Use `--dry-run` to inspect the lane without running it. Use `--no-block-on-conflicts` only when the slot conflict is understood and you intentionally want advisory behavior.

### E2E Entrypoint Policy (T9.9)

- Native `am e2e` is authoritative for operator and CI invocation.
- `scripts/e2e_test.sh` remains compatibility-only and emits deprecation guidance.
- Rollback condition: set `AM_E2E_FORCE_LEGACY=1` only if native runner regression is confirmed.

Verification checklist:
- `am e2e list` and `am e2e run --project . <suite>` succeed for targeted suites.
- Artifact repro commands reference `am e2e run` (not script-first commands).
- CI/release docs and runbooks do not present `scripts/e2e_test.sh` as the primary command.

### Verification Realism Policy

The canonical realism and closure policy lives in [docs/VERIFICATION_COVERAGE_LEDGER.md](/data/projects/mcp_agent_mail_rust/docs/VERIFICATION_COVERAGE_LEDGER.md).

- `R0` and `R1` are the lanes that carry closure weight.
- `R2` and `R3` substitutes are second-best evidence and must name their compensating real-path coverage.
- Stub-only lanes do not close transport, persistence, install/update, search-quality, LLM-quality, crypto/share, or operator-surface claims by themselves.

### Key Dependencies

## Performance and Benchmarking

The repository carries both stress tests and reproducible benchmark baselines. The two serve different purposes:

- **Stress suites** answer “does the system stay correct under ugly concurrency?”
- **Bench suites** answer “how fast is the operator and mailbox path right now?”

### Native `am bench`

The native CLI benchmark runner is built around four categories in `crates/mcp-agent-mail-cli/src/bench.rs`:

| Category | Built-in cases | What it measures |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Startup | `help` | Pure CLI startup and argument parsing |
| Analysis | `lint`, `typecheck` | Cost of native quality commands |
| Stub encoder | `stub_encode_1k`, `stub_encode_10k`, `stub_encode_100k` | Compact encoding subprocess path |
| Operational | `mail_inbox`, `mail_send`, `mail_search`, `mail_threads`, `doctor_check`, `message_count`, `agents_list` | Real mailbox/operator workflows over a seeded DB |

### Checked-In Baselines

These numbers come from [`benches/BUDGETS.md`](benches/BUDGETS.md), which records dated benchmark baselines and budgets.

#### CLI Operational Baselines (`am bench --quick`, 2026-02-09)

| Command | Baseline mean | Budget |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| `am --help` | 4.2ms | < 10ms |
| `am mail inbox` | 11.5ms | < 25ms |
| `am mail inbox --include-bodies` | 11.7ms | < 25ms |
| `am mail send` | 27.1ms | < 50ms |
| `am doctor check` | 5.8ms | < 15ms |
| `am list-projects` | 6.2ms | < 15ms |
| `am lint` | 457ms | < 1000ms |
| `am typecheck` | 399ms | < 800ms |

#### Search V3 frankensearch lexical-tier baselines (2026-02-18)

Tantivy is the lexical backend inside frankensearch; semantic and hybrid fusion are controlled by the `hybrid` feature.

| Corpus size | Baseline p50 | Baseline p95 | Baseline p99 | Budget p95 |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| 1,000 messages | ~382µs | ~531µs | ~706µs | < 1.5ms |
| 5,000 messages | ~622µs | ~800µs | ~1.1ms | < 5ms |
| 15,000 messages | ~679µs | ~805µs | ~1.0ms | < 15ms |

Index build throughput baseline from the same file is 7.5K docs/sec at 1K, 36K docs/sec at 5K, and 90K docs/sec at 15K, with roughly 89-107 bytes/doc of disk overhead.

#### Historical Archive Write Baselines (2026-02-08)

| Operation | Baseline p50 | Baseline p95 | Budget p95 | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Single message, no attachments | ~17.2ms | ~21.3ms | < 25ms | Healthy write path |
| Single message, inline attachment | ~22.0ms | ~26.0ms | < 25ms | Slightly over budget |
| Single message, file attachment | ~20.4ms | ~25.2ms | < 25ms | Marginal |
| Batch 100 messages | ~930ms | ~1076ms | < 250ms | Historical pre-fix baseline; superseded below |

These numbers are preserved as the pre-fix baseline for comparison.

#### Archive Write Baselines (2026-04-18)

| Operation | Baseline p50 | Baseline p95 | Budget p95 | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Single message, no attachments | ~11.7ms | ~12.4ms | < 25ms | Healthy warm-path write |
| Single message, inline attachment | ~22.0ms | ~26.0ms | < 25ms | Historical inline-attachment overrun remains tracked separately |
| Single message, file attachment | ~20.6ms | ~22.0ms | < 25ms | Healthy |
| Batch 100 messages | ~213.5ms | ~238.1ms | < 250ms | Fixed via storage-native batch bundle writes replacing the old per-message expansion loop |

The archive batch-write path is now under budget on the warm steady-state benchmark path. See `benches/BUDGETS.md` and the `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_batch_*` artifacts for the detailed p99/span breakdown.

### Reproduction Commands

```bash
# Native CLI benchmark catalog
am bench --list
am bench --quick

# Archive write path
cargo bench -p mcp-agent-mail --bench benchmarks -- archive_write

# Search V3 lexical path
cargo bench -p mcp-agent-mail-db --bench search_v3_bench

# Load / soak validation
cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-db --test sustained_load -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Hardware, kernel, and build profile matter. Treat these as checked-in reference baselines, not universal promises.

## Mailbox Diagnostics (`am doctor`)

Over time, mailbox state can drift: stale locks from crashed processes, unresponsive local servers, MCP config skew, archive/SQLite divergence, orphaned rows, legacy FTS/search-side schema drift, or outright database corruption. The `doctor` command group detects these issues, explains what it found, and can now automatically apply the common fixes.

```bash
# Run diagnostics (fast, non-destructive)
am doctor check
am doctor check --verbose
am doctor check --json          # Machine-readable output

# Audit/archive hygiene without mutating the mailbox archive
am doctor archive-scan
am doctor archive-scan --json
am doctor archive-normalize --dry-run
am doctor archive-normalize --yes

# Repair (creates backup first, prompts before data changes)
am doctor repair --dry-run      # Preview what would change
am doctor repair                # Apply safe fixes, prompt for data fixes
am doctor repair --yes          # Auto-confirm everything (CI/automation)

# Archive-first recovery
am doctor reconstruct           # Rebuild SQLite from the Git archive (+ salvage what it can)

# Full auto-remediation
am doctor fix --dry-run         # Preview all safe/automatic fixes
am doctor fix --yes             # Apply them without prompting

# Sanitized incident bundle for maintainer support
am doctor support-bundle --json
am doctor support-bundle --stdout-log /tmp/am.stdout --stderr-log /tmp/am.stderr --redact-subjects

# Backup management
am doctor backups               # List available backups
am doctor restore /path/to/backup.sqlite3
```

`am doctor locks --json` is the read-only owner report. Repair and reconstruct
refuse a live, wedged, or unsafe-to-touch owner by default. A separate
`reclaimable` class covers only a zombie or an unresponsive deleted-executable
owner that has exceeded the idle threshold. For that class alone,
`am doctor repair --take-ownership` (or `reconstruct --take-ownership`) wins a
per-mailbox election, rechecks the evidence, moves stale activity-lock files
into a witnessed quarantine, and then repairs. It never signals or kills the
owner; all other owner classes still require the supervised drain path.

What `check` inspects:

| Check | Detects |
|-------|---------|
| Local runtime | Port ownership, `/health`, JSON-RPC `health_check`, and runaway `mcp-agent-mail` CPU usage |
| MCP config | Legacy stdio/Python launcher entries, wrong HTTP URLs, missing Codex timeout settings |
| Database file sanity | Missing/zero-byte files, malformed relative paths, corruption signatures, reopen probe failures |
| Archive vs DB parity | Cases where Git-backed canonical mail artifacts are ahead of SQLite and a reconstruct is safer than repair |
| Archive hygiene | Missing/invalid `project.json`, duplicate canonical message ids, malformed canonical message files, and suspicious temp-project archive roots |
| Database integrity | `PRAGMA integrity_check`, foreign-key violations, orphaned recipient rows, missing core tables |
| Search/index state | Legacy FTS artifact presence, rebuildability, and search-side schema hygiene |
| Storage/runtime hygiene | Stale archive locks, WAL mode, expired reservations, writable storage root |

`am doctor archive-scan` is the non-mutating hygiene report for the Git archive itself. `am doctor archive-normalize` is the non-destructive remediation path for safe archive debt: it only rewrites `project.json` when the canonical absolute `human_key` is already known, and it quarantines duplicate canonical message files instead of deleting them. `am doctor repair` is the in-place SQLite hygiene path: it creates a backup, captures a forensic bundle, cleans orphaned rows, rebuilds legacy FTS artifacts if they still exist, and runs `VACUUM`/`ANALYZE`. `am doctor reconstruct` is the archive-first disaster-recovery path: it captures a forensic bundle, quarantines the bad database, rebuilds a fresh SQLite index from the Git archive, and merges any salvageable rows recovered from the old file while writing oversized warning sets to a report artifact instead of flooding the terminal. `am doctor support-bundle` creates a separate sanitized support artifact under `STORAGE_ROOT/doctor/support-bundles/`: it includes the current repair/reconstruct decision, schema/version shape, sidecar metadata, replay commands, redacted stdout/stderr when supplied, and sanitized copies of recent doctor reports. It deliberately omits raw SQLite files, canonical message files, message bodies, and attachments; pass `--redact-subjects` when subjects are sensitive. Review `manifest.json` before sharing because it lists every included file, redaction mode, source path class, and omitted evidence class. `am doctor fix` sits above both: it runs the full diagnostic pass, repairs MCP config and shell integration issues, removes stale archive lockfiles, enables WAL when needed, stops unhealthy local Agent Mail processes when the runtime health probes fail, and chooses between repair vs reconstruction based on what the probes found.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `"sender or recipients not registered"` | Register the sender and verify all recipient names are registered in the target `project_key` |
| `"FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT"` | Adjust patterns, wait for TTL expiry, or use non-exclusive reservation |
| Auth errors with JWT | Include bearer token with matching `kid` in the request header |
| Port 8765 already in use | `am serve-http --port 9000` or stop the existing server |
| TUI not rendering | Check `TUI_ENABLED=true` and that your terminal supports 256 colors |
| TUI appears **frozen** (render/input stuck, but the process is still serving MCP/API) | Do **not** kill the process. Run the non-interactive freeze escape hatch `am tui-dump --format json`: it returns the same situational snapshot the TUI renders, fetched live from `/mail/ws-state` (including a per-loop liveness verdict that names the stalled loop) and falling back to a local SQLite read if the whole process is wedged. Always exits 0. `am robot health --format json` also classifies the stall and points at the same read-out. If the freeze persists, restart headless: `mcp-agent-mail serve --no-tui`. |
| TUI shows **garbled / stale cells** (render corruption that clears on resize) | A guaranteed full redraw is bounded by wall clock: `AM_TUI_FULL_REDRAW_MAX_SECS` (default `1.0`s). Lower it (e.g. `0.25`) to repair incremental-diff desync faster, or set `<= 0` to disable the bound. Ensure you are on the latest build — confirm with `am --version` and reinstall via `./install-local.sh` if stale, since render fixes ship in the binary, not the running session. |
| TUI becomes **mostly blank after running for a while** | Upgrade to `v0.3.21` or later and confirm with `am --version`. Older builds could mistake a healthy 100 ms frame for a missed 16.6 ms budget and then replace most content with an `EssentialOnly` frame. Current builds keep the console at full visual fidelity under load; `am e2e run --project . tui_full_traversal` verifies this against an emulated terminal screen. |
| `Resource is temporarily busy` | The message includes the activity-lock owner PID, age, mode, subject, and executable when metadata is available. Run the read-only `am doctor locks --json`; do not remove lock files. Stale advisory metadata is reaped only after an exclusive-lock probe proves no kernel holder and records PID/executable liveness evidence. |
| Interactive `am` while a service is running | It attaches a read-only TUI snapshot and leaves the service running. Restart coordination uses a single mailbox mutex with bounded jittered backoff, so concurrent starts wait for a live peer instead of restart-fighting. Use `--takeover` only for an intentional replacement. |
| `CURSOR_EXPIRED` from `am inbox-events` | The saved delivery cursor fell below retained history. Start from `--position-now` for a new tail position, or choose a recovery policy using `oldest_available_cursor`; do not substitute a message ID. |
| Empty inbox | Verify recipient names match exactly and messages were sent to that agent |
| Search returns nothing | Try simpler terms and fewer filters; inspect diagnostics in `search_messages` explain output |
| Pre-commit guard blocking | Check `am robot reservations --conflicts` for active reservations |
| Tools time out / "Database corruption detected" under heavy load | Inspect the timeout response or `health_check` timeout diagnostics: they report `contended_path`, whether that stage exceeded the client deadline, p99 pool-acquire/database-write/archive queue/archive-commit latency, and blocking-dispatch occupancy. An unattributed dispatch timeout is reported as such, not blamed on SQLite. Also run `am robot health --include-host --format json`; if `host_pressure_likely` is true (low disk/inodes, high load-per-CPU, low free memory) or the data dir is not writable, relieve host pressure before reconstructing. |
| `am serve-http` shows systemd `active (running)` but port 8765 is **not reachable** (high memory, single thread) | A degraded/corrupt DB is making the startup recovery slow. The server binds the listener within `STARTUP_READINESS_BIND_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 20s) regardless, so `/healthz` returns 200 while the DB recovers in the background and `/health` reports `warming_up`/`unavailable`. If it persists: stop the service and run `am doctor --json`; or quarantine `storage.sqlite3*` (move, don't delete) and restart to rebuild from the Git archive. Fast unblock: `INTEGRITY_CHECK_ON_STARTUP=false am serve-http --no-tui`. |
| Kernel-log `segfault ... ip 0x1db250 ... in git[...]` | System has **git 2.51.0** which races `.git/index` under multi-agent load. See [Known-bad git versions](#known-bad-git-versions) below. |
| `fatal: bad object HEAD` or orphan stashes that appear after sessions | Same as above. Set `AM_GIT_BINARY` to a safer git, then run `am doctor fix-orphan-refs --all --dry-run`. |

### Known-bad git versions

mcp-agent-mail invokes `git` in a handful of places (pre-commit guard,
share export, reservation activity probes, project identity detection).
Some git versions have multi-process concurrency bugs that corrupt
`.git/index` under load:

| Version | Status | Primary mitigation |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| **2.51.0** | KNOWN BAD — segfaults in `cache_entry` walk under concurrent index writes (IP `0x1db250`). Ubuntu 25.10 "questing" is the main affected distro. | `export AM_GIT_BINARY=/path/to/git-2.50.x/bin/git` and/or upgrade to 2.51.1+ when available. See `docs/RECOVERY_RUNBOOK.md#git-2-51-0-index-race`. |

Run `am doctor check` to see whether your system git is flagged. The
check emits a structured finding (code `GIT_2_51_0_INDEX_RACE`, exit
code 3 in CI mode) so pipelines can gate on it.

`AM_GIT_BINARY` overrides the resolver used by all in-process git
shell-outs (identity detection, reservation activity, share/hosting,
etc.). libgit2 calls (vendored) are unaffected — they don't exhibit
this bug. Operators who have already migrated a path to libgit2 don't
need to do anything.

## Limitations

- **Rust nightly required.** Uses Rust 2024 edition features that require the nightly compiler.
- **Local patched dependencies.** Building from source expects local sibling checkouts in the parent directory for **eight** repos: `asupersync`, `fastmcp_rust`, `beads_rust`, `franken_agent_detection`, `frankentui`, `frankensearch`, `toon_rust`, and `rich_rust`. SQLmodel and FrankenSQLite resolve from crates.io.
- **Single-machine coordination.** Designed for agents running on the same machine or accessing the same filesystem. Not a distributed system.
- **Advisory, not enforced.** File reservations are advisory. Agents can bypass the pre-commit guard with `--no-verify`.
- **No built-in authentication federation.** JWT support exists, but there's no centralized auth service. Each server manages its own tokens.

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from the Python version?**
A: This is a ground-up Rust rewrite with the same conceptual model but significant improvements: a 16-screen interactive TUI, robot mode CLI, hybrid search, build slots, the product bus for cross-project coordination, and substantially better performance. The conformance test suite exercises 42 Python-parity tools plus 6 Rust-native tools, and all 25 MCP resources, against captured fixtures — ensuring format parity with the Python reference where parity is meaningful.

**Q: Do I need to run a separate server for each project?**
A: No. One server handles multiple projects. Each project is identified by its absolute filesystem path as the `project_key`.

**Q: How do agents get their names?**
A: Agent Mail generates memorable adjective+noun names (e.g., `GreenCastle`, `BlueLake`, `RedHarbor`) when agents register. Agents can also specify a name explicitly.

**Q: Can agents in different repos talk to each other?**
A: Yes. Use `request_contact` / `respond_contact` (or `macro_contact_handshake`) to establish a link between agents in different projects, then message directly. The product bus enables cross-project search and inbox queries.

**Q: Does this work with Claude Code's Max subscription?**
A: Yes. You can use a Max account with Agent Mail. Each agent session connects to the same MCP server regardless of subscription tier.

**Q: What happens if the server crashes?**
A: SQLite is the normal live state and the Git archive is the durable audit/recovery ledger. On a clean shutdown the commit coalescer flushes queued archive writes; after corruption or unrecoverable drift, `am doctor reconstruct` can rebuild SQLite from the archive.

**Q: How does this integrate with Beads?**
A: Use the Beads issue ID (e.g., `br-123`) as the Mail `thread_id`. Beads owns task status/priority/dependencies; Agent Mail carries the conversations and audit trail. The installer can optionally set up Beads alongside Agent Mail.

## Appendix: Protocol Transcript

This is what a realistic agent-to-agent coordination flow looks like on the wire. Agents do not need to memorize JSON-RPC; the value of this appendix is that it shows the explicit, auditable contract the system exposes.

### 2. Notify another agent

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"2","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"send_message","arguments":{
  "project_key":"/data/projects/acme-api",
  "sender_name":"BlueLake",
  "to":["GreenCastle"],
  "subject":"[br-123] Starting auth refactor",
  "body_md":"I have `src/auth/**` reserved. Please keep your edits in `src/http/**` for now.",
  "thread_id":"br-123",
  "ack_required":true,
  "importance":"high"
}}}
```

### 3. Peer fetches inbox and acknowledges

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"3","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"fetch_inbox","arguments":{
  "project_key":"/data/projects/acme-api",
  "agent_name":"GreenCastle",
  "limit":20,
  "include_bodies":true
}}}
```

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"4","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"acknowledge_message","arguments":{
  "project_key":"/data/projects/acme-api",
  "agent_name":"GreenCastle",
  "message_id":1482
}}}
```

### 4. Reply in-thread

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"5","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"reply_message","arguments":{
  "project_key":"/data/projects/acme-api",
  "message_id":1482,
  "sender_name":"GreenCastle",
  "body_md":"Understood. I am staying in `src/http/**`. Ping me before changing token parsing."
}}}
```

### 5. Release the reservation when done

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"6","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"release_file_reservations","arguments":{
  "project_key":"/data/projects/acme-api",
  "agent_name":"BlueLake",
  "paths":["src/auth/**"]
}}}
```

One deliberate non-feature: `broadcast=true` on `send_message` is intentionally rejected. The system wants explicit routing, not default spam.

## Appendix: TUI vs. Web vs. Robot

The project exposes the same underlying state through three different surfaces. They are optimized for different operators, not different data.

| Surface | Best for | Output style |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| TUI | Live human operations and triage | Dense interactive cockpit |
| Web UI | Browser-based review and overseer intervention | Server-rendered HTML routes under `/mail/` |
| Robot CLI | Agent loops, hooks, and machine-readable snapshots | `toon`, `json`, and `md` |

### Representative TUI Shape

```text
┌ Dashboard ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ unread: 12   urgent: 2   ack_overdue: 1   reservations: 5              │
│ top threads: br-123, br-140, infra-cutover                             │
│ anomalies: 2 acks overdue | 1 reservation expiring < 15m               │
├ Screens ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1 Dashboard  2 Messages  3 Threads  4 Agents  5 Search  6 Reservations │
│ 7 Tool Metrics  8 System Health  9 Timeline  0 Projects                │
│ ! Contacts  @ Explorer  # Analytics  $ Attachments  % Archive Browser  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Representative Web Shape

```text
/mail/
  Unified Inbox
  Filter: importance=high
  Project: acme-api

  [high][ack required] #1482  [br-123] Starting auth refactor
  From: BlueLake   To: GreenCastle   Thread: br-123
  Quick links: thread | attachments | project overview | reservations
```

### Representative Robot Shape

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "command": "robot status",
    "format": "json",
    "project": "acme-api",
    "agent": "BlueLake",
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "_alerts": [
    {
      "severity": "warn",
      "summary": "2 acks overdue",
      "action": "am robot inbox --ack-overdue"
    }
  ],
  "_actions": [
    "am robot reservations --conflicts"
  ],
  "health": { "status": "ok" },
  "inbox_summary": { "total": 12, "urgent": 2, "ack_overdue": 1 }
}
```

The reason the three surfaces coexist is pragmatic. Humans need a cockpit and a browser view. Agents need compact, deterministic snapshots. All three ride on the same mailbox state.

## Ready-Made Blurb for Your AGENTS.md

Add this to your project's `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` to help agents use Agent Mail effectively:

```
## MCP Agent Mail: coordination for multi-agent workflows

What it is
- A mail-like layer that lets coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources.
- Provides identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads, and advisory file reservations,
  with human-auditable artifacts in Git.

Why it's useful
- Prevents agents from stepping on each other with explicit file reservations (leases).
- Keeps communication out of your token budget by storing messages in a per-project archive.
- Offers quick reads (`resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>`, `resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>`) and macros that bundle common flows.

How to use effectively
1) Register an identity: call ensure_project with this repo's absolute path as
   `human_key`, then call register_agent using that same absolute path as `project_key`.
2) Reserve files before you edit: file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name,
   paths=["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)
3) Communicate with threads: use send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123"); check inbox
   with fetch_inbox and acknowledge with acknowledge_message.
4) Quick reads: resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20

Macros vs granular tools
- Prefer macros for speed: macro_start_session, macro_prepare_thread,
  macro_file_reservation_cycle, macro_contact_handshake.
- Use granular tools for control: register_agent, file_reservation_paths, send_message,
  fetch_inbox, acknowledge_message.

Common pitfalls
- "sender or recipients not registered": register the sender first and verify recipient names in the correct project_key.
- "FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT": adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use non-exclusive.
```

## About Contributions

Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them directly. Instead, I'll have Claude or Codex review submissions via `gh` and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.
