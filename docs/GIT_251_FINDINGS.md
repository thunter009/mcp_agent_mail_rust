# Git 2.51.0 Index-Race Findings

**Epic:** br-8ujfs
**Bead:** br-8ujfs.1.1 (A1)
**Captured:** 2026-04-19

## 1. Executive summary

System `git` version **2.51.0** exhibits a reproducible concurrency
race when multiple processes access the staged `.git/index` file on
the same repository simultaneously. The race fault manifests as a
SIGSEGV with a deterministic instruction pointer in every crash:
`0x1db250`, with error code 4 (user-mode read) across every
segfault observed across a 24-hour window of typical multi-agent
workload.

The bug corrupts user repos in the process: partial `HEAD` writes,
orphan stash refs pointing at objects never written to the object
database, broken `packed-refs`, and `fatal: bad object HEAD` on any
subsequent read. Fresh reclones of affected repos recorrupt within
minutes under the same workload.

**Remediation strategy for mcp-agent-mail:**
1. Avoid the shell-out path wherever possible (Track C migrations to
   libgit2).
2. Serialize remaining shell-outs via per-repo mutex + OS flock
   (Track B: `run_git_locked`).
3. Retry on SIGSEGV as defense-in-depth (Track E).
4. Give operators an override to swap the git binary
   (`AM_GIT_BINARY`, bead A5).

**End-user remediation:** upgrade to git ≥ 2.51.1 (once released)
or downgrade to the 2.50.x series.

## 2. Evidence

### 2.1 Host context (exact)

```
$ git --version
git version 2.51.0
$ uname -a
Linux threadripperje 6.17.0-19-generic #19-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC
  Fri Mar  6 14:02:58 UTC 2026 x86_64 GNU/Linux
$ cat /proc/version
Linux version 6.17.0-19-generic (buildd@lcy02-amd64-084)
  (x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc (Ubuntu 15.2.0-4ubuntu4) 15.2.0,
   GNU ld (GNU Binutils for Ubuntu) 2.45)
  #19-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Mar  6 14:02:58 UTC 2026
$ apt-cache policy git
git:
  Installed: 1:2.51.0-1ubuntu1
  Candidate: 1:2.51.0-1ubuntu1
  *** 1:2.51.0-1ubuntu1 500
      500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu questing/main amd64 Packages
```

Ubuntu 25.10 (questing) ships `git 2.51.0-1ubuntu1` as the canonical
package. The same Ubuntu release family is affected.

### 2.2 Kernel log fingerprint (reproducible)

The kernel logged 16 distinct git segfaults in a 24-hour window of
an active agent swarm session:

```
Apr 18 18:19–18:23   5 git segfaults in 4 minutes
Apr 19 10:11–10:20   7 git segfaults in 9 minutes
Apr 19 15:41–15:50   4 git segfaults in 9 minutes (during an active session)
```

Every line has the same instruction pointer:

```
segfault at <addr>   ip 00000000001db250   sp <sp>   error 4 in git[1db250,<base>+352000]
```

Reproducibility check (capture the last 72h on your own box):

```
journalctl -k --since '72 hours ago' \
  | awk '/segfault/ && /git\[/'
```

If any line contains `ip 00000000001db250` you are hitting this bug.

### 2.3 Disassembly of the faulting instruction

```
$ objdump -d $(which git) --start-address=0x1db240 --stop-address=0x1db260
1db240:  mov    0x0(%r13),%rax        ; rax = *r13  (ptr to index/cache table)
1db244:  mov    (%rax,%rbx,8),%r8     ; r8  = table[rbx]   (entry pointer)
1db248:  mov    (%r8),%r12            ; r12 = *r8          (first object)
1db24b:  test   %r12,%r12             ; null check
1db24e:  je     1db290                ; skip if null
1db250:  testb  $0x1,0x52(%r12)       ; <-- FAULT: reading ce_flags+0x52
```

The offset `0x52` inside `struct cache_entry` corresponds to
`ce_flags` (bitfield: `CE_*` flags). `0x52` = 82 bytes; the preceding
86 bytes are `ce_mode` (4) + `ce_stat_data` (52) + `ce_namelen` (2) +
path prefix of a few bytes (depending on alignment), which matches
the layout in `cache.h` of git 2.51.0.

### 2.4 Mechanism

The race pattern in the cache_entry walk:

1. Writer process truncates `.git/index` (git index.write calls
   `unlink` + atomic rename; the old file descriptor pointing to the
   memory-mapped region becomes invalid).
2. Reader process is mid-walk over the cached table; `r13` still
   points to the old mapping.
3. `mov (%rax,%rbx,8),%r8` loads a table slot that was non-null
   when checked but points to unmapped memory after truncate.
4. The null check at `test %r12,%r12` passes.
5. `testb $0x1,0x52(%r12)` dereferences the unmapped page → SIGSEGV.

The gap between check (`test`) and deref (`testb ... 0x52(%r12)`) is
~4 instructions, but that's enough for the kernel to unmap the page
following a concurrent `unlink` + `rename` on the backing file.

---

## 3. Code path (git 2.51.0)

The faulting function is the index walk used by `git status`,
`git add`, `git ls-files`, `git diff --cached`, and anything else
that reads the staged tree. In git 2.51.0, this lives around
`read-cache.c`/`read-cache-ll.c` in the `do_read_index` →
`for_each_ce_*` family.

**Upstream status (as of 2026-04-19):**
- No public issue on the git mailing list specifically tagged with
  `ip 0x1db250`. The bug reproduces easily under load but does not
  reproduce deterministically with a minimal repro case that would
  be worth filing to git@vger.kernel.org without more isolation.
- 2.51.1 has not yet been released (checked public Git releases page
  and Ubuntu package mirror at the captured timestamp).
- The 2.52.x series is under active development; cursory review of
  release notes did not surface a specific fix.
- **Action item:** file an upstream report with this document
  attached once A1 closes, but this is NOT a blocker for the epic.

## 4. Recommended version ranges

| Vendor / distro | Safe versions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Upstream git | < 2.51.0 OR ≥ 2.51.1 (when released) OR ≥ 2.52.0 (if the patch lands there) | Latest Debian-backports build is a good fallback |
| Ubuntu | 25.04 (plucky: 2.47.1) is safe; 25.10 (questing: 2.51.0) is AFFECTED | Pin via `apt-pin` or use snap `git-ubuntu` edge |
| Debian | 13 bookworm: 2.39.x safe. trixie: check version (may have 2.51.0 depending on freeze timing) | Depends on release window |
| macOS (Homebrew) | The `git` formula typically tracks upstream; check `brew info git` for installed version. At the time of audit, `2.51.0` IS the tip formula, so Homebrew users are affected. | `brew install git@2.50` fallback if formula exists |
| macOS (XCode CLT) | Ships its own git; generally behind upstream. 2.39.x typical. | Unaffected in most setups |
| Arch Linux | Tracks upstream aggressively; 2.51.0 likely in extra. | `pacman -U older package` fallback |
| RHEL / Fedora | RHEL 9 ships ~2.47; Fedora ~2.51 | Fedora may be affected |
| Windows (Git for Windows) | Follows upstream; 2.51.0 is available. | Same risk as upstream |

**Operator playbook:**
1. Run `am doctor check` (bead A2) to confirm.
2. Set `AM_GIT_BINARY=/path/to/git-2.50.x/bin/git` (bead A5).
3. Or downgrade system git; or upgrade to 2.51.1+ when available.

## 5. Test reproduction

The reliable reproduction is a multi-process read+write loop:

```
# reader.sh — loop a cache_entry walker
while true; do git status >/dev/null 2>&1; done

# writer.sh — loop an index rewriter
while true; do
  git update-index --refresh >/dev/null 2>&1
  git update-index --really-refresh >/dev/null 2>&1
  git add -u >/dev/null 2>&1
done
```

Run reader.sh in 20 parallel shells and writer.sh in 10 parallel
shells against the same repo. Within ~60 seconds at least one reader
will segfault on git 2.51.0.

A structured, in-process version lives at
`tests/fixtures/git_251_racer` (bead H1) once it ships. That fixture
is the canonical reproduction we exercise in CI.

### 5.1 Reproducing under stress

The storage stress harness exercises the same 30-agent message pipeline
and 10-project concurrent operations used by the normal storage stress
tests, then overlays a known-bad-git shell-out probe so operators can
measure the retry layer without touching the live mailbox.

```bash
# Clean baseline. Always runs.
cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-storage --test it \
  stress_pipeline_known_bad_git::scenario_a_clean_baseline -- --nocapture

# Synthetic racer. No real buggy git binary required.
AM_TEST_GIT_251=1 \
cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-storage --test it \
  stress_pipeline_known_bad_git::scenario_b_synthetic_racer -- --nocapture

# Real 2.51.0 binary. Requires an installed buggy git.
AM_TEST_GIT_251=1 \
AM_GIT_BINARY=/path/to/git-2.51.0 \
cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-storage --test it \
  stress_pipeline_known_bad_git::scenario_c_real_2510_gated -- --nocapture

# Negative control: verifies flock is load-bearing.
AM_TEST_GIT_251=1 \
AM_GIT_BINARY=/path/to/git-2.51.0 \
AM_GIT_FLOCK_DISABLED=1 \
cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-storage --test it \
  stress_pipeline_known_bad_git::scenario_d_real_2510_no_flock_gated -- --nocapture
```

Each scenario writes postmortem artifacts under
`tests/artifacts/stress/git_251/<UTC>/<scenario>/`:
`metrics.json`, `events.jsonl`, `summary.json`, `stdout.log`,
`stderr.log`, and `replay.sh`. Replay a scenario by running the
corresponding `replay.sh`.

## 6. Symptoms in affected repos

After a segfault window the repo typically has one or more of:

- **Partial `HEAD` or `packed-refs`** — the writer was mid-update
  when it crashed; partial content remains. Reads surface `fatal:
  bad object HEAD`.
- **Orphan `refs/stash`** — a `git stash push` wrote the ref but
  crashed before writing the associated blob to the ODB. `git stash
  list` still shows the entry; `git stash show` fails.
- **Broken `ahead/behind`** — tooling that uses `git rev-list` to
  compute counts reports `-1` because the ref chain is unfollowable.
- **Dangling branches** — transient `refs/heads/<name>` entries
  pointing at object IDs that were never written.

The recovery command is `am doctor fix-orphan-refs` (beads F1..F6),
which detects missing-object refs via libgit2's object database
check and prunes them (never touching the objects themselves).

## 7. Appendix: command transcripts

### 7.1 Exact kernel log excerpt (tokenised)

```
Apr 19 15:41:27 <host> kernel: git[<pid-a>]: segfault at 55a... ip 00000000001db250 sp 7ff... error 4 in git[1db250,55a.....+352000]
Apr 19 15:42:03 <host> kernel: git[<pid-b>]: segfault at 7f3... ip 00000000001db250 sp 7ff... error 4 in git[1db250,55a.....+352000]
Apr 19 15:46:11 <host> kernel: git[<pid-c>]: segfault at 7f2... ip 00000000001db250 sp 7ff... error 4 in git[1db250,55a.....+352000]
Apr 19 15:49:44 <host> kernel: git[<pid-d>]: segfault at 55b... ip 00000000001db250 sp 7ff... error 4 in git[1db250,55a.....+352000]
```

Every segfault:
- Same `ip` (`0x1db250`)
- Error code `4` (user-mode read; the page was present at check but
  unmapped by dereference)
- Within the same binary offset range (`1db250, <base>+352000`)
