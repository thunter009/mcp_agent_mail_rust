# Bridge Plan: MCP Agent Mail (Rust)

## September 23, 2026 assessment (black-box A/B)

**The coordination product is real and its core loop works end to end, but
neither artifact a user can obtain today is fit for sustained multi-agent use.**
The shipped v0.3.36 leaks SQLite descriptors until it fails (EMFILE within one
minute of ordinary mixed load at the default 1,024 limit; the live host daemon
is at 13.9k and will exhaust its manually raised 32k limit around October 1–2)
and never repairs archive copies orphaned by a crash. Source HEAD bounds the
descriptors, but under the same black-box load its archive write-behind drain
blocked indefinitely while health reported archive lag green. The missing
piece is not another feature or audit: it is a bounded, black-box, release-mode
acceptance run between "the fix landed" and "users receive it." Neither defect
is caught by the default in-process stress suites (HEAD: `stress_pipeline` 9/9);
only an ignored sustained 100-agent test times out, and it may be the same stall.
310 commits since v0.3.36 are unreleased.

This section supersedes the September 22 judgment. Unlike the September 21/22
desk reviews, its central evidence is fresh execution by this assessment:
the shipped and HEAD binaries driven side by side on the same host through the
MCP HTTP protocol, as an agent would drive them.

### What was actually run

- **Governing documents:** all of AGENTS.md (1,372 lines), README.md (2,063),
  VISION.md, the suite-wide rules, and this plan's September 21/22 sections were
  read in full. Source cut `e7744d7a` (main = master = origin), tree clean apart
  from untracked `.rch-tmp/`.
- **Tracker:** local `beads.db` was schema v17 while br 0.6.0 requires v19; the
  reviewed, reversible `br doctor migrate-schema` (17→19) was applied (undo id
  `20260923T161910.038668Z-3818208-0`), `br doctor` then reported JSONL/DB in sync
  at 2,720 records. 43 open + 93 in progress + 12 blocked = **148 unfinished**,
  2,364 closed, `br dep cycles` empty.
- **Black-box harness** (session scratchpad, not committed): Python MCP-over-HTTP
  client doing `initialize` → tools; isolated `HOME`/`STORAGE_ROOT`/`DATABASE_URL`
  per server; ports 18765 (installed **v0.3.36**, SHA-256 `e6cf98a3…`, identical
  to the live daemon's executable) and 18766/18767 (**HEAD `e7744d7a` debug build**,
  SHA-256 prefix `c5922763`). Phases: README coordination flow (27 checks), 16-client
  send storms (240 sends), SIGKILL mid-storm + restart + read-back of every
  server-acknowledged id, 10-minute mixed soak (2 senders, 2 inbox readers,
  search, health) sampling `/proc/<pid>/fd`, and archive convergence observed with
  no client reads.
- **Live host (read-only):** MCP `health_check`, `/proc` of the port-8765 owner,
  timed `am robot`/`am doctor` read verbs, `doctor fix --only … --list`.
- **Tests:** a full default-feature workspace nextest was attempted twice and is
  **NO_VERDICT**: the RCH fleet had 3/14 then 0/12 slots (hz3 queue timeout), and
  the local attempt was stopped by me at 59 GB free (97% disk, shared host) before
  linking completed. Focused HEAD suites, run per package through nextest in the
  same private target under a 50 GB free-disk watchdog, are reported below with
  their exact counts. No release, publication or live repair was performed.
- **Source moved during the assessment:** origin/main advanced to `e538b0dd`
  (5 commits, 16:27–16:46 local: agent-discovery routing, late-model search
  recovery, ACK idempotency across outages, committed-archive proof before
  retention pruning with `message_reconcile/database.rs` +640 lines, reservation
  renewal ownership). **No finding here was re-run against them.** The drain wedge
  (`br-kp1in.13`) must be re-reproduced on the newest main before attribution.
- **Parallel read-only audits** (four subagents, results spot-checked): documented
  surface counts, stub/ignored-test scan, 12 open + 6 recently closed GitHub
  issues against HEAD, and all 39 P0 in-progress beads against code.

### Findings, ranked by user impact

1. **Shipped v0.3.36 exhausts file descriptors (REGRESSED in the field; fixed in
   source, unreleased).** Isolated 0.3.36 under the mixed soak: `storage.sqlite3`
   descriptors 277 → 609 → 763 in 60 s; at the 1,024 soft limit (systemd user-unit
   default, and the installer-generated unit sets no `LimitNOFILE`) the process
   logged `No file descriptors available` 597×, restarted its HTTP server 257×,
   failed 58 post-commit durability probes, fell back to archive snapshots for
   inbox reads, and hit `archive HEAD points at a missing/corrupt object … re-root`
   66× (`git fsck` afterwards: only dangling trees); the 10-minute soak ended at
   995 descriptors with 34,960 client-visible errors. Live daemon PID 1685075 (bare `am`,
   TUI; the supervised `agent-mail.service` has been inactive since September 17):
   13,835 → 13,886 descriptors on `storage.sqlite3` over 6.08 days of uptime,
   ≈2,000–2,300/day, soft limit 32,768 (raised by hand after the September 18
   2,048-limit outage recorded on `br-8r6dl`). **HEAD under the identical soak held
   2 descriptors throughout.** Owner: `br-8r6dl`; defense in depth: `br-kp1in.17`.
2. **HEAD's archive write-behind drain wedges under mixed load (NEW, P0, blocks
   release; `br-kp1in.13`, health verdict `br-kp1in.23`).** HEAD instance with a SIGKILL history: WBQ `drained_total` frozen at
   414 from about 16:37Z to the end of the session (≥19 minutes, including after
   load stopped) while `enqueued_total` rose to 3,870 (depth 3,453); no archive
   commit after 16:36:54 while the DB grew to 3,927 messages against 692 archived;
   the `wbq-drain` thread sat in `futex_do_wait` with zero CPU ticks over 10 s
   (blocked, not slow — a debug build cannot explain zero progress). 41
   `fetch_inbox` dispatches hit the 30 s deadline and became zombies holding
   admission capacity (zero successful reads in the 10-minute soak);
   `read-only WAL admission refused pending recovery` ×28.
   Health stayed `archive_lag: green, oldest_unmaterialized_ms: 0` — the lag
   contributor does not observe WBQ backlog. Clean-instance reproduction (no crash
   history): see the reproduction record below.
3. **Crash orphans are never repaired by the shipped binary (fixed in source,
   unreleased).** After SIGKILL, 0.3.36's two kill-orphaned messages were never
   archived (DB 311 / archive 309 at restart; the gap persisted for the ~30 minutes
   observed, with 23 uncommitted archive files); DB→archive
   reconciliation (`br-8j6cb`, `0c906599`/`8b631146`) is not in v0.3.36. **Zero
   acknowledged messages were lost on either binary** (305/305 on 0.3.36, 297/297
   on HEAD, all ids distinct) and full integrity passed after restart on both.
4. **Cross-project messaging silently misdelivers (NEW; had no bead, now
   `br-kp1in.15`).** After a
   successful cross-project `macro_contact_handshake`, `send_message` from project
   A to the linked agent's name auto-registered a placeholder `BronzeHare
   (unknown/unknown)` **in project A**, delivered there, and returned a receipt with
   `persisted: true`; the real recipient in project B received nothing. The
   handshake itself drops `welcome_subject/body` for cross-project pairs with only
   a debug log (`tools/src/macros.rs:765`, "messaging across projects not yet
   supported"). README's Quick Start shows exactly that handshake and says
   separate repos can "link agents, then message directly"; the FAQ repeats it.
   Python never supported this either; the promise is simply unimplemented.
5. **Write concurrency mode is implicit (NEW; had no bead, now `br-kp1in.16`).** VISION/README say
   `BEGIN CONCURRENT` is opt-in and off. That is true only for explicit
   transactions: the pinned engine's autocommit path uses
   `TransactionMode::Concurrent` whenever `concurrent_mode_default` is true, which
   is its default (`fsqlite-core/src/connection.rs:14649, 56669` at `db458bfb`), and
   the runtime never sets `PRAGMA fsqlite.concurrent_mode = OFF` (only two tests
   do). HEAD logged `MVCC write conflict … snapshot conflict on pages` under a
   16-client storm. `pool.rs:2618` still cites "≥10 concurrent autocommit writers
   UNSUPPORTED (bd-9inpb)" while the engine's own test says the bd-9inpb fix
   landed. The effective mode for the durability claim must be decided and pinned.
6. **HEAD admission/latency under writers is unqualified.** 2 of 720 HEAD sends
   returned `RESOURCE_BUSY: database is busy (recovery in progress)` (0 of 480 on
   0.3.36 — not statistically distinguishable at this n, but a release gate must
   measure it); HEAD's engine logged `correlated_exists_fallback` ("in-memory
   fallback path while parity-cert mode is enabled"). Debug-build latencies are
   not release evidence; they are why a release-mode run is mandatory.
7. **CLI reads contend with the live daemon.** On the 42k-message live mailbox:
   `am robot search` 36.5 s (Tantivy `LockBusy` → private-snapshot fallback with an
   `error` alert), `am robot health` 6.6 s, `am doctor health` 7.7 s and exit 1.
   Other read verbs 0.1–2.6 s. GH#298's residual (health_check walks the archive
   per call; CLI read verbs are not proxied) had no owner; now `br-kp1in.18`.
8. **Live reservation archive drift is persistent and semantic.** `am doctor
   health` exits 1 on 16 reservations whose `released_ts`/`active_status` differ
   between DB (4,102 rows) and archive (2,960), the same count as September 22.
   The auto-fixer exists but nothing converges it automatically, and the
   pre-commit guard reads archive state. No mutation was applied (`br-kp1in.19`).
9. **Release plumbing points at a path that never runs.** Repository Actions are
   disabled; releases go through DSR with minisign. Several release-integrity beads
   were satisfied only in `dist.yml`/`docker.yml` (static tests in
   `tests/docs_drift_ci.rs`); nothing on the DSR path consumes a zero-failure gate
   (`br-nq2kb`; v0.3.34 shipped with 12 failing tests). One-shot "landing"
   workflows (`land-atc-reliability-20260918.yml`, `gh326-private-export.yml`,
   `gh274-overview.yml`, `installer-exit.yml`) and `patches/` were committed for a
   CI that cannot run; the GH#326 patch series was never applied (`br-kp1in.22`,
   `br-kp1in.27`).
10. **Smaller verified defects:** GH#329 (`file_reservations release/renew
    --paths/--ids` accept one value) and GH#330 (robot reservation times only
    humanized) are unfixed and unowned; the engine emits
    `WAL-FEC requires a caller-owned native runtime` at WARN once per connection
    open (≈8,000 lines in 20 minutes on each server); 8 config variables are parsed
    and never read (`LLM_DEFAULT_MODEL` — LLM calls use a hard-coded `gpt-5.4` —,
    `LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_INCLUDE_TRACE`, `DATABASE_ECHO`, `HTTP_OTEL_*`,
    `AM_EPHEMERAL_TTL_HOURS`, `AM_TUI_TREE_STYLE`) and three are parsed twice with
    divergent defaults (`FSQLITE_CONCURRENT_RETRIES` 5 vs 16, `AM_COALESCER_*`);
    `MCP_AGENT_MAIL_LLM_STUB=1` makes release builds return canned LLM output
    (`br-kp1in.24`, `.25`, `.26`, `.20`, `.21` respectively).

### What is verifiably working

- **Surface:** 45 tools (`tools/list` = 45 on both binaries), 25 resource URIs
  (33 registrations incl. query variants), 16 screens, 19 robot verbs, 28 doctor
  verbs, 65 fixers / 27 auto-fixable, 42 themes, 12 members, no Tokio family in
  either lockfile. Zero `todo!`/`unimplemented!`; every tool handler has a real body.
- **Coordination loop (27/27 on both binaries):** register, symmetric-glob
  reservation conflict, release and re-grant, send/fetch/ack/reply,
  delivery receipt, search, thread summary, `resource://inbox`, inbox-event cursors,
  broadcast refusal, invalid-name refusal, `file_reservation_paths` idempotent
  replay and `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_CONFLICT`.
- **Durability of acknowledged writes across SIGKILL** on both binaries (above).
- **All robot/doctor/mail verbs** answer in 0.02–1.2 s on a small mailbox.
- **HEAD focused suites:** storage `stress_pipeline` 9/9 passed (6 ignored
  skipped), including the 30-agent pipeline, WBQ saturation and 120-agent
  multi-project cases — the in-process sources of README's stress table. Further
  focused-suite results are recorded below.
- **Six GitHub defects have source fixes** (#326, #328, #323, #264, #258, #274
  partial) — none is released. #319/#318/#321 fixes are released.
- **Stale P0 wave:** of 39 P0 in-progress beads, 15 have code plus tests for every
  acceptance item, 21 are partial (often only a missing run or negative test),
  3 are obsolete (`br-ivcmf`, `br-rch-frankensearch-closure-jdgvg`, `br-l1z6f`),
  none is untouched. `br-c2is6` (master mirror) is already satisfied at `e7744d7a`.

### Reproduction record for the HEAD drain wedge

| Instance | History | Drain froze at | Queued at last sample | After load stopped | Health `archive_lag` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A (port 18766) | SIGKILL + restart, 3 storms, 10-min soak | 414 (~16:37Z) | 3,453 | still 414 at 16:56Z; zombies 41 | green, `oldest_unmaterialized_ms: 0` |
| B (port 18767) | fresh, no crash; flow, 2 storms, 5-min soak | 679 (~16:48Z, ~90 s into soak) | 1,624 | still 679 at 16:56Z; zombies 20 | warning, 104–228 s |
| v0.3.36 control | same workload | never | 2 | drains normally | — |

The wedge is permanent once reached (no recovery after load removal) and does not
require a crash. `am` still accepts and acknowledges sends into SQLite, so no
acknowledged message is lost, but reads time out, zombies accumulate, and the
archive, search backfill and every Git-backed guarantee stop advancing.

### Vision checklist delta (the September 21 25-goal matrix remains the inventory)

Only goals re-exercised in this pass change status; all others keep their
September 21/22 status (`UNPROVEN`/`PARTIAL`) and were **not** re-verified.

| # | Goal | Sept 22 | This pass | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 45 tools / 25 resources | PARTIAL | **WORKING** (both binaries) | `tools/list`=45 black-box; source counts |
| 2 | Explicit send/reply/read/ack, receipts | PARTIAL | **WORKING** at small scale | 27/27 flow on both binaries |
| 3 | Broadcast refused | implemented | **WORKING** | `BROADCAST_DISABLED` black-box |
| 4 | DB→Git convergence | PARTIAL | **REGRESSED on HEAD (wedge)**, NOT_SHIPPED fix on 0.3.36 | findings 2–3 |
| 5 | No lost/duplicate accepted mail under concurrency | UNPROVEN | **WORKING at 16 clients incl. SIGKILL**; swarm scale UNPROVEN | 602/602 acked ids survive; distinct ids |
| 7 | Bounded engine/pool lifetime | PARTIAL | **REGRESSED in shipped** (EMFILE), **WORKING on HEAD** (2 fds) | finding 1 |
| 8 | Identity/contact/topic | PARTIAL | PARTIAL + **new misdelivery defect** | finding 4 |
| 9 | Leases, conflicts, guard | PARTIAL | **WORKING** (tool path) / live archive drift persists | flow + finding 8, GH#329 |
| 15 | Fast, truthful robot/doctor health | PARTIAL | PARTIAL: fast on small mailbox; 36 s search, 7.7 s doctor health, lag verdict wrong under wedge | findings 2, 7 |
| 17 | Scoped Search V3 | PARTIAL | PARTIAL: MCP search 0.15 s small; CLI 36 s live | finding 7 |
| 20 | Signed install/update | PARTIAL | PARTIAL: installed binary = release asset; 310 commits unreleased | GitHub API, SHA |
| 22 | Complete gate | UNPROVEN | **NO_VERDICT, now explained**: ~100 GB of test executables | `br-kp1in.28` |
| 23 | Latency/resource budgets | UNPROVEN | UNPROVEN; README's 27 ms send baseline is not what users see (2.6–3.5 s observed sequential on a loaded shared host, confounded) | finding 10, `br-kp1in.5` |
| 24 | Honest active docs | PARTIAL | PARTIAL: ten verified drifts appended to `br-4meup` | `br-4meup` comment |

### Bead coverage (skill questions 4 and 5)

**If every open and in-progress bead were completed as written, would the gap
close?** Before this pass: **no**. Nothing owned the HEAD drain wedge, the
cross-project misdelivery, the implicit concurrency mode, the lag verdict, the
runnable full gate, or a bounded black-box release gate — and several release
beads target a pipeline (Actions) that is disabled. The long-horizon soak beads
(`br-kp1in.1/.2`) would eventually have exercised the wedge, but they are scoped
as 24-hour two-host programs blocked on four other beads.

**Vision goals with no bead before this pass (now created, parent `br-kp1in`):**

| New bead | P | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| `br-kp1in.13` | P0 | HEAD archive drain wedge (release blocker) |
| `br-kp1in.14` | P0 | Bounded black-box release smoke with previous-release control (release blocker) |
| `br-kp1in.15` | P1 | Cross-project send misdelivery / handshake welcome drop / README promise |
| `br-kp1in.16` | P1 | Explicit effective write-concurrency mode for autocommit writes |
| `br-kp1in.17` | P1 | Descriptor-limit defense in depth (soft-limit raise, unit `LimitNOFILE`, doctor) |
| `br-kp1in.22` | P1 | Decision: canonical release path; re-scope dist.yml-only release beads |
| `br-kp1in.23` | P1 | `archive_lag` verdict ignores WBQ backlog |
| `br-kp1in.28` | P1 | Consolidate 137 integration-test binaries so the full gate can run |
| `br-kp1in.29` | P1 | Liveness instruments: lockdep-lite, holder dumps, progress/slope watchdogs |
| `br-kp1in.30` | P1 | Un-ignore the passing 100-agent lifecycle test; classify the 600 s sustained timeout |
| `br-kp1in.18` | P2 | CLI read verbs contend with the daemon (36 s search), GH#298 residual |
| `br-kp1in.19` | P2 | Reservation DB/archive semantic drift without automatic convergence |
| `br-kp1in.20` | P2 | Config surface honesty (8 dead + 3 double-parsed variables) |
| `br-kp1in.21` | P2 | `MCP_AGENT_MAIL_LLM_STUB` honored by release builds |
| `br-kp1in.24` | P2 | GH#329 multi-value `--paths/--ids` |
| `br-kp1in.26` | P2 | WAL-FEC WARN once per connection open |
| `br-kp1in.25` | P3 | GH#330 absolute reservation timestamps |
| `br-kp1in.27` | P3 | Repo detritus (removal needs maintainer approval under RULE 1) |

New blocking edges (left depends on right): `br-bx73n` → `.13`, `.14`, `.22`, `.23`,
`.28`; `br-nq2kb` → `.22`. Related links tie the new beads to `br-8r6dl`,
`br-8j6cb`, `br-0flbu`, `br-es9fm`, `br-vsj5s`, `br-kp1in.1/.2/.7`. Evidence comments
were added to `br-8r6dl`, `br-8j6cb`, `br-5lgwn`, `br-4meup`, `br-nq2kb`, `br-0flbu`,
`br-c2is6` (already satisfied) and the three obsolete beads (`br-ivcmf`,
`br-rch-frankensearch-closure-jdgvg`, `br-l1z6f`). No existing bead was closed,
reassigned or re-prioritized; closure is left to owners with the cited evidence.

### Bridge: the shortest route from here to a release users can trust

1. **Unwedge HEAD (`br-kp1in.13`, P0, M).** Reproduce in a spawned-binary test
   (the clean instance B recipe needs no crash), take stacks with the server as a
   harness child (ptrace allowed), fix the blocking wait at its root. Add the
   drain-progress verdict (`br-kp1in.23`) in the same change set so the next stall
   cannot report green.
2. **Commit the bounded black-box release smoke (`br-kp1in.14`, P0, M) in
   parallel.** It must fail today on both artifacts for the stated reasons; that
   failing receipt is the proof the gate works.
3. **Make the full gate runnable (`br-kp1in.28`, P1, M–L).** Consolidating test
   binaries is what turns every future "full gate NO_VERDICT" into a verdict.
4. **Pin the concurrency mode (`br-kp1in.16`)** before the release-mode run, so the
   durability numbers mean something.
5. **Release.** Decide the path (`br-kp1in.22`), run consolidated full gate +
   smoke on a release-mode build of the exact candidate, installed-binary parity
   (`br-bx73n`), publish. This ships the descriptor fix, DB→archive
   reconciliation, and the six unreleased GitHub fixes.
6. **Operational, now (maintainer's call — not done by this assessment):** the
   live daemon PID 1685075 will hit its 32,768 descriptor limit around October
   1–2. A restart resets the count (and the supervised unit is available but
   inactive); the durable fix is step 5. Consider `LimitNOFILE` on the unit
   meanwhile (`br-kp1in.17`).
7. **Then, in parallel:** cross-project correctness (`.15`), CLI read contention
   (`.18`), reservation drift convergence (`.19`), liveness instruments (`.29`),
   config honesty (`.20`, `.21`), GH#329/#330, log flood, docs (`br-4meup`).
8. **Keep the long-horizon program** (`br-kp1in.1/.2/.9/.10`, swarm-scale
   GH#257/#278) — but it is not a prerequisite for shipping steps 1–5.

### Ambition round 1: liveness is a first-class property

Both release blockers are liveness failures — resource exhaustion and a blocked
drain — in a codebase whose ~17k tests are overwhelmingly safety checks. The plan
therefore treats "keeps making progress with bounded resources" as a product
invariant with instruments, not an emergent property: named-lock order recording
and holder dumps so the next wedge diagnoses itself without ptrace; per-queue
progress watchdogs; resource-slope detection against completed work using the
anytime-valid e-process/CUSUM machinery the ATC core already contains; and a
time-to-exhaustion projection ("EMFILE in ~9 days") in `am robot health` and
`am doctor`. The September 18 outage was predictable from data the process
already had. Recorded in `br-kp1in.29`; the release smoke asserts the same
predicates, and gains randomized crash-point iterations (≥20 kills at random
offsets, offsets recorded for replay) instead of one hand-timed SIGKILL.

### Ambition round 2: make verdicts cheap enough to get every time

The recurring NO_VERDICT on the full gate is not bad luck: ~137 integration-test
executables at ~700 MB each is ~100 GB per build, more than this host or most
workers have free. Consolidation per crate (`br-kp1in.28`) and a minutes-long
black-box smoke (`br-kp1in.14`) make a trustworthy verdict affordable on one
machine, which in turn makes small, frequent releases possible (`br-kp1in.22`
records cadence with the path decision). Health reports time-to-drain from
measured arrival and drain rates (Little's law), so "behind but converging" and
"wedged" are different colors (`br-kp1in.23`).

### Ambition round 3 (considered, deliberately bounded)

Lock-order graphs (lockdep), anytime-valid sequential tests for leak slopes, and
Little's-law drain estimates are the mathematically grounded pieces that pay for
themselves here, each tied to an observed defect. A general model checker or a
new chaos framework was considered and rejected for this bridge: the existing
bounded history checker (`br-kp1in.9/.10`) already owns trace legality, and adding
more checks without an observed defect class would be the "conformance
metastasis" pattern AGENTS.md forbids.

### Focused HEAD test results (cargo nextest, default profile, debug line-tables-only)

| Suite | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| storage `stress_pipeline` (default) | **9/9 passed**, 6 ignored skipped, 201.6 s | thundering herd, coalescer batching, inbox during storm, 30-agent pipeline, mixed reservations+messages, 120-agent multi-project, multi-project concurrency, stale git lock, WBQ saturation |
| `stress_100_agent_full_lifecycle` (ignored) | **passed**, 105.9 s | its "un-ignore on fsqlite bump" condition is met → `br-kp1in.30` |
| `stress_sustained_100_agents_60s` (ignored) | **TIMEOUT at 600.1 s** (nominal 60 s) | unclassified: same stall class or debug slowness → `br-kp1in.30` |
| db/tools suites (stress, pool exhaustion, fault injection, idempotency, nocase backup) | queued behind per-package rebuilds at handoff | results, if any, recorded on `br-kp1in` |

The full default-feature workspace gate remains **NO_VERDICT** for the reasons above;
no count is projected for it.

### Refinement record (Phase 3a and five Phase 5 passes)

Phase 3a used the frozen bead-generation instruction retained verbatim in the
September 21 section; Phase 5 used the frozen refinement instruction. Beads carry
background, reasoning, acceptance, unit/E2E tests and logging requirements so they
are self-contained without this document.

1. **Ownership:** `.13`, `.23` and `.29` each proposed a drain watchdog. Assigned one
   owner each (root-cause fix / health verdict / cross-cutting instruments); added
   structured-logging and E2E requirements to `.13`, `.16`, `.19`, `.23`, `.24`, `.29`.
2. **Duplicates and links:** `bv --robot-suggest` flagged nothing for the new beads;
   a manual sweep found no existing owner for test consolidation; linked `.20` to
   `br-yzk37` (inert pragma knobs) and `.14` to `.15`/`.29`.
3. **Dependency semantics:** corrected `.13`'s prose — it blocks release acceptance
   (`br-bx73n`) but deliberately not `.14`, whose failing run against the wedge is
   its proof of usefulness.
4. **Evidence accuracy:** corrected `.14`'s description of the live outage (observed:
   2,048 limit exhausted within about a day of the 09-17 start; the October 1–2 date
   is a projection). Scanned the plan and JSONL for the local bearer token that
   appeared in this session's terminal output: absent.
5. **Convergence:** added `.30` from the final suite result; re-read all 18 new beads
   and the graph; no further change warranted. `br dep cycles` empty; `bv
   --robot-triage`: 166 unfinished, acyclic, top picks `br-kp1in.13` then
   `br-kp1in.14` (previously `br-c2is6`, which is already satisfied).

### Real-work and honesty disposition

This was a user-requested assessment (PROCESS), but unlike the three preceding
desk assessments most of its weight is fresh execution: two binaries driven
black-box through the real protocol, a same-host A/B, a crash test, a soak, live
`/proc` measurements, and focused suites. It changed no product code, test, gate,
golden, default or configuration; it made one reversible local tracker schema
migration, created 18 beads, added 11 evidence comments and 11 dependency edges,
and revised this plan in place. No bead was closed or reassigned; peers' obsolete
or satisfied beads received evidence for their owners to act on.

Limits stated plainly: HEAD was a **debug** build — its latencies are not release
evidence, though the zero-CPU blocked drain thread is a wedge, not slowness; the
full gate is NO_VERDICT; sample sizes for the RESOURCE_BUSY comparison are small;
the harness lives in the session scratchpad (to be ported by `br-kp1in.14`), and
its storm/soak shapes are mine, not a standard workload. Surface counts, the stub
scan, the GitHub audit and the P0 audit came from read-only subagents; I
spot-checked the concurrency-mode, cross-project and reservation-drift claims
myself and reproduced two of them black-box.

What this assessment left behind on the host: a 58 GB private build target at
`~/.cache/rc0923-target` (RULE 1: not deleted without the maintainer's approval),
isolated fixture mailboxes under the session scratchpad, and stopped test servers.
No shared mailbox was modified.

## September 22, 2026 assessment (superseded by September 23)

**Agent Mail is a substantial working product. Its remaining critical work is
reliable operation across failures and delivery of one fully qualified current
candidate. It is not finished, and the latest source is not the released binary.**
This assessment supersedes the dated judgments below without changing their
receipts or treating old failures as present failures.

### Scope and current evidence

- Reread all 1,372 lines of repository `AGENTS.md`, all 2,063 lines of
  `README.md`, and all 663 lines of the governing suite instructions. Reviewed
  the current vision, durability, security, browser, verification and release
  contracts. The full historical plan/spec survey recorded below is reused,
  not represented as a fresh reread of every historical document. Since its
  September 21 source cut, the only changed Markdown files are AGENTS, README
  and this bridge plan.
- Source cut: `41bf1305c5d1554a3e4edc0ad53ff302d8ba7e03`. Both remote branch
  tips matched it during this assessment. The working source was clean;
  existing Beads changes and `.rch-tmp/` were preserved.
- Live GitHub API still reports **v0.3.36**, published September 16 at
  10:14:19 UTC, with 15 uploaded assets. Local `am --version` also reports
  0.3.36; a version string does not establish source or executable identity.
  Main is 305 commits after the local release tag. The release's reported
  17,547 passing tests and 36 skips belong to its pre-version-bump candidate,
  not this source cut. No release was installed or published in this audit.
- Current JSONL contains **44 open, 93 in progress, 12 blocked and 2,363
  closed** issues, plus 208 tombstones. `br doctor` identified a local
  materialization mismatch; ordinary `br sync --import-only` imported the
  missing `br-q8z1r` without changing the existing issues. Unfinished total is
  **149**. Stale titles, ownership flags and closure counts are not correctness
  evidence. No existing implementation owner is displaced by this assessment.
- Fresh live MCP coordination persisted message 42912 for both addressed
  peers; its delivery receipt reports persisted, not signaled or acknowledged.
  The live health call returned `status=ok` and **health_level=red**: critical
  verdicts green, pressure red. WBQ p95 was 1,049 ms; commit-queue p95 was
  4,195 ms. Message inventories were 42,306 archive / 42,335 DB, within the
  configured tolerance, not row-level equality. These are live observations,
  not a controlled performance experiment or current-source test.
- Local `am doctor health` exited 1 for `local_config_unattested` with 32
  reservation-field differences. It did not attest the live server target;
  do not combine that result with the MCP health result. No shared repair ran.
  CASS reports a stale, incomplete August 14 checkpoint, so current history
  comes from Git, Beads and retained receipts, not claimed fresh CASS coverage.
  The bounded current-task CASS search timed out after 20 seconds without a
  result; its index was not rebuilt during this assessment.

### What has materially improved

The following are implemented repairs with retained, bounded evidence, not
additional work to reimplement:

| Change | Evidence and boundary |
|---|---|
| Idle stdio archive reconciliation | `ce784836` starts the existing maintenance worker; real idle and accepted-send/outbox-failure/restart subprocess cases passed at their recorded cuts. |
| Reply metadata survives repair and ordinary Git commits | `7352a3d3`; 80/80 selected tests, including six staged-only replies repaired in fresh processes. This does not prove the transport batch cursor. |
| Live model discovery recovers after late installation | `br-drpda`, published through `169143db`; real registered-model discovery/context/embedding passed. It does not certify full semantic indexing or retrieval. |
| Queue configuration reaches the implementation | `640831a3`, `br-dqbpk`; the enqueue-deadline counterexample and 32/32 focused tests passed. Idle-poll configuration reached its consumer in source review; no separate nondefault idle-poll timing measurement ran. |
| Idempotency retries retire obsolete pooled readers | `167b7815`, `br-9m5il`; 7/7 focused native tests, workspace check and strict Clippy passed on the recorded matching source. |
| Lost lifecycle profile writes have background repair | `41bf1305`; bounded 32-identity/four-repair passes, project locking and reconstruction support exist. Seven isolated helper tests and ten SQL checks are narrower than native DB/Git or transport acceptance; those remain unverified. |

Receipts for the September 22 work are retained under
`/data/projects/am-release-20260912/`, particularly
`20260922-rainyforest-staged-final-receipt.json`,
`20260922-rainyforest-wbq-timing-receipt.json`,
`20260922-rainyforest-idempotency-stale-reader-receipt.json`, and
`20260922-rainyforest-pressure-stdio-receipt.json`.

The pressure fixture is preserved outside the primary source at
`/data/projects/am-release-20260912/wbq-publication-ff0346/` in
`crates/mcp-agent-mail-cli/tests/integration_runs.rs`. Final frozen candidate
`08755a914763a35e50e5c840c03d8f6688d4c2d2` is unpublished. Formatting and scoped
static review passed; **zero native pressure tests executed**. A smaller worker
ran out of memory, the larger worker timed out during compilation, and final
admission was refused. The timeout's cleanup was subsequently verified and
worker health restored. These are infrastructure limitations, not a test pass
or a demonstrated failure of the fixture. No own build remains active.

### Vision checklist and gap coverage

The 12-crate architecture is coherent: CLI/server entrypoints feed FastMCP and
shared tools; FrankenSQLite holds live operational rows; storage queues and Git
hold recoverable artifacts; core owns contracts/configuration; search, guard,
share, robot, TUI and authenticated HTML are consumers. Asupersync is the runtime.
The embedded Beads engine is separate from the mailbox engine. Optional hybrid
source builds and lexical portable releases are distinct products to qualify.

`PARTIAL` below means implementation exists but the complete promise still has
known work or missing decisive evidence. It does not mean the whole surface is
broken. The existing 25-goal matrix below remains the detailed inventory; this
table updates its acceptance groups against current code.

| Goals | Current reality | Remaining work and existing owner beads |
|---|---|---|
| 1–3: tools/resources and explicit messaging | Real handlers and fresh persisted coordination; broadcast refusal remains intentional. Current complete conformance UNPROVEN. | `br-s3xbp`, `br-w9v59.1`, `br-kp1in.1/.2` |
| 4–5: durability and safe retry | DB-first acknowledgement, metadata persistence, bounded repair and stale-reader fix implemented; fault/restart composition PARTIAL. | `br-8j6cb`, `br-q8z1r`, `br-kp1in.2/.9/.10` |
| 6–7: recovery authority and engine lifetime | Real generation, descriptor, snapshot and recovery machinery; latest whole-candidate qualification UNPROVEN. | `br-5lgwn`, `br-xzgcj`, `br-jgieq`, `br-qfvd6`, existing recovery owners |
| 8: identity/contact/topic | Real lifecycle tools and newly wired profile repair; whole imported-mailbox lifecycle round trip PARTIAL. | `br-sgaee`, `br-g6c0z`, `br-qayvs` |
| 9–10: leases/guard/product/build slots | Real coordination; keyed empty-grant conflict race remains a source-supported defect awaiting a runtime reproducer. | `br-q8z1r`, `br-9bwnb`, `br-ssog9`, `br-kp1in.2` |
| 11–12: setup and credentials | Discovery/setup and authority hardening exist; race and exact-install acceptance PARTIAL. | `br-db75q`, `br-fphbm`, `br-6u4hx`, `br-x2jf5`, existing setup/installer owners |
| 13–16: operator surfaces, share and doctor | Real FTUI, HTML, robot, crypto and reversible repair; selected older evidence is substantial, combined candidate UNPROVEN. | `br-ivgot`, `br-l4fk6`, `br-ji2f0`, `br-qdgio`, `br-kp1in.2/.5/.6` |
| 17–18: search and optional quality | Lexical path real; model discovery now tested. Late-model vector-index identity and real transport quality remain PARTIAL. | `br-kp1in.7/.8`, `br-7x5fm`; preserve lexical fallback |
| 19: quiet ATC and learning | Runtime hooks, persistence and snapshots exist; defaults remain shadow/write-off. Sustained mixed-workflow acceptance UNPROVEN. | `br-hwney`, `br-au76r`, `br-kp1in.1/.2` |
| 20–22: release, import and complete gates | Published v0.3.36 exists. New dependency/recovery work is source-only; manual scorecard and installed parity PARTIAL. | `br-5lgwn`, `br-bx73n`, `br-kp1in.3/.4`, `br-nq2kb`, existing legacy/platform owners |
| 23: performance | Historical budgets and real benchmark paths exist. Today's latency/resource targets UNPROVEN; MVCC is still opt-in with an explicit drift warning. | `br-kp1in.5/.6`, `br-eru3j`, health/stress owners |
| 24–25: truthful scope and browser replay | Public replay uses the real screen with synthetic identifying data. Live browser parity is deliberately deferred. Active vision prose still conflicts with newer safe startup/release policy. | `br-4meup`, `br-f9avw.10`, `br-mq9q1`; cutover/crates.io remain explicit decisions |

**Would completing the existing Beads finish the project?** They cover every
current feature family found in this review. Literal execution of stale task
descriptions would not: some ask for already-landed wiring or obsolete dependency
migrations. Completing their updated behavioral acceptance, including actual
installed artifacts and sustained runs, would close the known scoped gaps.
That is not proof against undiscovered bugs. No new feature family or new audit
epic is justified. Missing acceptance connections belong in the existing graph.

### Ordered bridge and granular execution TODO

1. **Finish the current recovery candidate (M, critical).**
   - [ ] `br-8j6cb`: execute the preserved real pressure/restart fixture through
     strict RCH on a memory-adequate admitted worker, using the exact final
     source/features and a functioning nextest runner. Do not restart a cold
     multi-package build merely to obtain another queue refusal.
   - [ ] Verify actual journal-enqueue failure, backlog exhaustion, seven
     accepted messages spanning the four-repair limit, idle restart and exact
     canonical/outbox/inbox Git bytes; no read/resend trigger or read/ack change.
   - [ ] Retain attachment, topic, exact reply, wrong-generation, interruption,
     foreign-path and missing-byte cases from the original acceptance. The
     existing pressure fixture alone does not cover all of them.
   - [ ] `br-sgaee`: execute the new production DB/Git lifecycle tests and a
     mounted retire/restart/unretire/deregister/reconstruct history. Verify
     routing/roster agreement and no resurrection, not only helper serialization.
2. **Fix the remaining exact-retry hole (S–M).**
   - [ ] `br-q8z1r`: deterministically interleave the tool's precheck with a real
     competing DB grant; show the successful empty result currently loses its
     key, then record/replay that result atomically. Releasing the competitor
     must not let an old key acquire a new lease. Preserve changed-payload
     conflicts, partial grants, retention expiry and concurrent same-key winner.
   - [ ] Carry that negative case into `br-kp1in.2/.9/.10`; authoring may proceed
     now, but full workflow certification must wait for the product fix.
3. **Qualify one combined revision (M–L).**
   - [ ] `br-5lgwn`: freeze main, lockfile, feature selection and worker target;
     reuse one admitted remote build lane for focused tests and mandatory
     workspace/all-target check, Clippy, formatting and full nextest.
   - [ ] Reclassify the earlier 36 skips against current dependencies. Preserve
     every failed attempt; selected old green runs do not qualify the latest
     lifecycle/reconstruction additions. No local fallback or inferred ELF.
   - [ ] Existing recovery/setup/import owners supply their named positive and
     adversarial probes at that candidate; do not duplicate their implementations.
4. **Prove the composed user workflow (L).**
   - [ ] `br-kp1in.1/.2/.9/.10`: bounded real stdio/HTTP smoke, then owned faults
     and restart, then the existing two-host 24-hour, 90-client, 13-project,
     300-message/hour profiles. Keep receipts, scopes, cursor semantics, quiet
     ATC, resource slopes and legal operation histories separate from counts.
5. **Qualify optional quality and performance in parallel (M each).**
   - [ ] `.7/.8`: real transport indexing/query after a model appears late;
     preserve model/dimension identity, privacy canaries and truthful fallback.
     Existing real discovery/embedding results are prerequisites, not retrieval
     proof. Unselected optional models do not block a lexical-only candidate.
   - [ ] `.5/.6`: measure offered/admitted/completed work, tail latency, retries,
     archive convergence and FD/RSS growth on the actual selected route. Keep
     cold startup separate from steady state; do not relax historical budgets.
6. **Deliver the verified candidate (M).**
   - [ ] `br-kp1in.3/.4` and `br-bx73n`: finish executed-child identity and
     selected-capability evidence, candidate-bound reliability scorecard and
     installed-binary parity. The mtime-selection bug is already repaired.
   - [ ] `br-nq2kb` and release owners: existing manual DSR/RCH gates, six target
     packages, signatures, actual install/update, applicable containers and
     ACFS checksum refresh. No Actions enablement or publication in this audit.
7. **Correct active guidance while preserving scope (S).**
   - [ ] `br-4meup`: distinguish new DB `archive_metadata_json` from legacy
     unknown reply metadata; current idempotency schemas from old prose;
     opt-in setup from the old auto-rewrite vision; lexical releases from
     optional hybrid; historical skip counts from present acceptance.
   - [ ] Keep deliberate non-goals: broadcast, hostile same-account isolation,
     federation and deferred live browser parity. No new scope is needed to
     finish the current product.

### Ambition round 1: prove the recovery workers together

Separate message and profile passes can each succeed while their shared Git,
locking or reconstruction interactions remain wrong. Extend the existing
`br-kp1in.2` private workflow with both missing message artifacts and lost
retire/deregister profile writes in one mailbox. Use enough accepted messages
and changed identities to cross each four-repair bound; keep adding ordinary
activity while older records wait. Observe actual progress for both classes,
then restart and reconstruct privately. Verify exact reply/topic/recipient
metadata and lifecycle authorization together, preserving BCC and registration
token confidentiality. Heartbeat-only changes must not create commit churn.
This extends the existing runner and product tests, not a second chaos system.
`br-8j6cb` and `br-sgaee` retain their original acceptance and cannot close merely
because a helper or one type of repair passes.

### Ambition round 2: check the contract the user actually observes

Use the existing bounded history checker to distinguish durable results from
fresh observations. A replay must preserve message or grant identity, original
expiry and the recorded empty/partial result; its live conflict snapshot may
legitimately change. Never infer reacquisition from an old expired grant or a
durability guarantee from an acknowledgement receipt alone. Challenge that
predicate with `br-q8z1r`'s competing grant/release schedule and independent
hand-labeled histories, alongside actual retained DB/Git evidence.

For source-to-release completion, bind acceptance to the executable that will
ship, including its feature and engine closure. Reuse one admitted build and
the existing scorecard/parity machinery; do not create a new certification
framework. The current helper-only lifecycle validation and unexecuted pressure
fixture make combined candidate qualification a real prerequisite of release
acceptance. Keep the larger two-host swarm goal distinct from the selected
release policy: this audit neither silently adds a new release gate nor waives
an existing one. Runtime capability, static checks, qualification and publication
remain four different outcomes.

### Refinement passes

1. **Scope and superseded assumptions:** rewrote `br-8j6cb`'s current
   description to stop requesting completed stdio wiring. It now distinguishes
   new transactional reply metadata, legacy unknown metadata, preserved staged
   evidence and the unexecuted transport-pressure fixture. All original positive
   and negative acceptance remains; no task was closed or reassigned.
2. **Behavior and test realism:** checked production message metadata, the
   reservation conflict return, real lifecycle test setup and semantic bridge
   construction. Added an actual late-model indexing/query case to `.8`, with
   lexical fallback and vector-space negatives. Isolated embeddings, plausible
   backend names and empty results cannot qualify retrieval. The model-dimension
   concern is source-supported and still awaits a runtime reproducer. Existing
   pressure coverage cannot absorb attachment/reply acceptance it never executes.
3. **Causal dependency order:** added four blocking edges with `br` only:
   `.2 -> br-q8z1r`, `.2 -> br-sgaee`, `br-bx73n -> br-5lgwn`, and
   `br-bx73n -> br-kp1in.4`. The left task depends on the right. Mixed-workflow
   certification now explicitly waits for the remaining retry/lifecycle
   contracts; installed-candidate acceptance waits for combined qualification
   and its evidence tests. Harness authoring need not wait. No blanket epic
   barrier or new sustained-run release prerequisite was introduced. The
   post-batch `br dep cycles --json` check reports no active cycles.
4. **Evidence and release scope:** reread the retained pressure and timing
   receipts and the current release requirements. Corrected the queue summary
   to separate measured enqueue timing from reviewed idle-poll wiring. The
   pressure receipt's original candidate limitation predates its final-candidate
   integration record; the final `08755a91` includes `41bf1305`, but neither
   candidate ran its pressure tests. Live health, unattested local doctor output,
   stale CASS, historical release tests and current source remain distinct.
   Selected lexical and optional hybrid acceptance stay separate; existing
   release gates and larger project goals are neither combined nor waived.
   Updated `.3/.4`'s stale descriptions: exact producer-receipt/run/digest
   selection is already implemented. Their unchanged acceptance now clearly
   targets executed-child identity, complete joins and real adversarial tests;
   manual release venue selection is no longer presented as unresolved.
5. **Convergence:** reviewed the affected task descriptions, acceptance,
   comments and graph after those corrections. No further scope, test or
   dependency changes were justified. All 14 updated issues retain their
   status, assignee, priority, original acceptance fields and prior comments;
   no issue was created, removed or closed. All referenced IDs resolve and
   JSONL has no duplicate IDs. Final `br dep cycles --json` reports zero cycles;
   `bv --robot-triage` also reports an acyclic graph with 149 unfinished issues.
   Its 124 structurally actionable items include in-progress work and stale
   titles, not 124 unowned implementation opportunities. Its top mirror-sync
   suggestion is already satisfied at this source cut and is not new work.

### Requested assessment workflow

- [x] Full governing-document reread, current source/release/tracker comparison,
  live bounded probes, vision-to-code map and initial bridge.
- [x] Phase 3a: reconcile existing Beads using the frozen prompt retained below.
- [x] Two ambition rounds, revising this section in place; regenerate Beads.
- [x] Five refinement passes, ending without further changes; validate with
  `br dep cycles` and `bv --robot-triage`.
- [x] Review the exact assessment diff and prepare only the intended plan/tracker
  changes. Record actual publication and reservation release in the final handoff.

Creation-gate worksheet: this is PROCESS, requested explicitly by the user for
implementation steering. The consumer is that user; the decision is which
remaining product work to do next. Observed defects are stale tracker/source
assumptions and unexecuted combined recovery acceptance. This section retires
as active guidance at the next assessment; historical evidence is retained.
The integrity-control exception is unnecessary. Ready `br-q8z1r` and remaining
`br-8j6cb` acceptance offer more runtime value than extending this report after
the requested phases finish. This assessment earns zero capability credit.

Real-work audit and honesty disposition: this requested turn changed one
existing plan and existing tracker records, with four new causal dependencies.
It contains no product implementation, performance improvement, test execution,
new runtime validation or release qualification. Recent code fixes and their
bounded receipts are credited separately above. No test, gate, assertion,
golden, default, source file or tool configuration was changed; no subagent
was delegated this audit, and persisted peer mail is not independent review.
The risk is extending planning while real recovery work waits; the correction
is to stop after this requested assessment and use the existing code-bearing
tasks. Future status must not count these planning edits as product progress.

Validation of this documentation/tracker change: whitespace checks and semantic
JSONL review passed; existing issue ownership and acceptance were preserved.
The required scoped UBS invocation returned exit 3 because Markdown/JSONL are
unsupported: **nothing was scanned, and this is not a scanner pass**. No
allow-no-scan override was used. No compiled checks were run for this audit;
the source and release verdicts above remain unchanged.

## September 21, 2026 assessment

**The product is substantial and useful, and its ordinary workspace gate has
passed since the previous assessment. The current dependency migration, sustained
reliability, archive convergence under failure, and strict release acceptance are
still unfinished.** Prioritize those outcomes over more features or another
planning campaign. This section supersedes the dated conclusions below; retained
historical failures are not a current failure count.

### Evidence boundary

**Implementation investigation correction:** bounded DB-to-archive reconciliation
already exists in `storage/src/recovery/message_reconcile/database.rs` and is
called by the server retention worker. HTTP and TUI start that worker; stdio
omitted it. Earlier conclusions inferred missing machinery from stale comments.
The stdio lifecycle wiring and real idle-session regression landed in
`ce784836`; failure-path qualification remains in progress. Threaded messages
without surviving authoritative reply metadata remain deliberately deferred.

**Execution update:** the strict RCH baseline workspace/all-targets Clippy run
completed successfully on `vmi1264463` at 15:10:24 UTC, September 21 (536 seconds;
`/tmp/rainyforest-archive-baseline-clippy.log`, exit 0). This supersedes the
baseline Clippy NO_VERDICT below, not the wider release gate. Subsequent stdio
wiring and its integration test require their own validation.

The stdio wiring now has real-process evidence: strict RCH nextest on
`vmi1264463` passed `serve_stdio_reconciles_db_only_mail_without_client_reads`
in 12.826 seconds (one test passed; 81 outside the selection), terminal
September 21 at 16:18:17 UTC. The private fixture verifies initialized stdio,
canonical/outbox/inbox content in Git HEAD without client reads/retries, and
unchanged read/ack state. Retained log:
`/data/projects/am-release-20260912/20260921-rainyforest-stdio-reconcile-pass.log`.
The preceding capacity refusal and 1,800-second compilation timeout are excluded
attempts, not test failures or passes. This closes the observed wiring defect's
positive regression, not the bead's full fault/restart acceptance. The patch
received a two-file UBS scan with 98 critical and 3,924 warning heuristic
findings, not a clean full scan. September 22 triage established that all 98
critical findings also occur at unchanged HEAD: test panics and test-executable
setup, route/status comparisons misidentified as secrets, snapshot directory
names, and guarded CORS/JWT test paths. The supported baseline comparison
completed with zero new critical findings and 30 warning/10 informational
records, reviewed as test assertions/setup, fixed paths, bounded polling and
ordinal-shifted existing statements. No suppressions or scanner rules changed.
The installed scanner omitted per-finding output due to a missing helper path;
an isolated copy of the same binary linked to its existing helpers produced the
complete comparison. This is patch-level review, not full-scan/release clearance.
Edited-source workspace/all-targets check passed at 16:27:07 UTC (480.6 seconds)
and Clippy with `-D warnings` passed at 16:29:30 UTC (102.1 seconds), both through
strict RCH on the same worker. Fresh formatting and whitespace checks passed.
`br-g2ip0` is closed for its compiler/format scope; this is self-verification,
not independent review or broader release acceptance.

**September 22 failure/restart qualification:** 25 existing storage reconciliation
tests passed through strict RCH on `vmi1264463` (405 outside selection; 5.225
seconds). Both CLI subprocess tests then passed (81 outside selection; 58.189
seconds total), including a real accepted send, an observed outbox write failure,
an abrupt owned-process stop, and an idle restart that commits all three message
copies without reads/resends or read/ack changes. The journal directory was also
unavailable, but the journal-enqueue failure branch and backlog exhaustion were
not exercised. The first fixture incorrectly blocked the canonical ID scan and
was refused before acceptance; its failed run is retained separately. Correcting
the obstruction to the outbox preserved every acceptance assertion. Logs are
`20260922-rainyforest-reconcile-controls.log` and
`20260922-rainyforest-restart-pass.log` under the artifact directory above.
The broader bead remains in progress for the original journal/backlog,
attachment, threaded-metadata and interrupted-repair acceptance. Existing unit
negatives support their own scope; they do not replace those transport cases.
Final workspace/all-target check and Clippy with warnings denied passed through
strict RCH at 01:47:55 and 01:48:55 UTC, respectively; formatting passed. The final
complete UBS baseline comparison exited 0 with zero new critical findings;
83 warnings and 32 informational records were reviewed as test setup/assertions,
fixed paths, bounded polling and shifted pre-existing occurrences. The full
historical scan remains nonzero. All verification here was self-executed.

**Integration with newer main:** before pushing, origin/main had advanced by 18
commits to `5e5a73d4`. The clean merge includes new durable-recipient authority,
legacy/cross-project routing, exact attachment recovery, journal authority,
bounded Git/retry admission and ATC population scoping. These are existing
upstream implementations to qualify, not missing features to duplicate. The
pre-merge results above do not qualify this combined candidate. Selected
recovery/stdio tests passed; workspace check passed at 02:24:20 UTC. Incoming
formatting drift was corrected manually; two
delegates handled eight files and the parent reviewed their full diffs and
reran formatting checks. One intentional, caught test panic needed a documented
same-line UBS false-positive exception after formatting changed its fingerprint.
The 14-file comparison against incoming main exited 0: zero new critical,
230 warning and 66 informational findings, reviewed as test setup/assertions,
fixed-path heuristics and unchanged production statements moved by formatting.
The untriaged report is retained; no broad scanner rules or test gates changed.

The first merged stdio run exposed a real integration defect: the new compound
source query deferred every repair with `bind parameter index out of range: 1`.
The pinned engine evaluates compound `LIMIT` without the supplied bindings.
The source query now renders only the fixed internal row budget as an integer
literal, with explicit bound indices for IDs and size limits across both arms.
Single-statement observation, payload limits and the excess-recipient witness
remain intact. The failing terminal run is retained as
`20260922-rainyforest-merged-source-bind-failure.log`: one failed, 58 not run,
3,404 outside selection. After the fix, all 59 selected tests passed in 83.884
seconds (57 storage controls and two stdio subprocess cases; 3,404 outside
selection), terminal September 22 at 02:17:16 UTC on `vmi1264463`. Fail-fast was
disabled to execute every selected control; assertions and pass conditions were
unchanged. Receipt: `20260922-rainyforest-merged-recovery-pass.log`. Fifteen
source/lock hashes matched the worker; the executed `am` SHA-256 was
`64c301bd33bfe5160f688fb0496c98c1ee7cb132b2bf053f6c3a5856e0dbc0a9`.

Merge `48af590d` subsequently reached main and its required mirror. Final-source
workspace/all-target Clippy with warnings denied passed through strict RCH at
02:51:13 UTC after direct fixes to incoming diagnostics: documentation markup,
borrowed journal errors, a boxed private repair error, and equivalent ATC/retry
test syntax. No assertions, lint rules or runtime refusal conditions changed.
The 14-file UBS comparison still exits 0 with zero new critical findings,
230 warnings and 66 informational records; the last changed fingerprint is the
same breaker-identity test assertion with explicit pointer syntax.

Final-source runtime qualification passed through strict RCH on `vmi1264463`:
100/100 tests at 03:19:43 UTC (57 archive reconciliation, 39 boot-repair, two
retry and two real stdio cases; 11,597 outside selection; 76.241 seconds after a
25m55s build). The actual `atc::population::scope` module then passed 17/17 at
03:20:24 UTC (11,680 outside selection; 0.609 seconds), correcting the initial
filename-style filter that matched none of those tests. Logs are
`20260922-rainyforest-final-selected-tests-pass.log` and
`20260922-rainyforest-final-atc-scope-tests-pass.log` in the artifact directory
above. Fifteen source files and Cargo.lock match the worker; the executed `am`
SHA-256 is `2823775d964be14cea7360120c7f6645b16fe2c742fa15dd2487c0bc96d348e7`.
Final workspace/all-target check passed at 03:23:32 UTC; formatting and whitespace
checks pass. These selected checks do not close
the original journal/backlog transport acceptance, independent review, or the
full release gate; the broader recovery bead remains open.

**Further upstream integration:** checkpoint `3979cf4e` retains the verified
117-test result above. Incoming ACK pagination and canonical-identity recovery
through `e5b1e7bf` initially failed compilation because pool acquisition returned
the driver error instead of `DbError`. After correcting that conversion, the
real pinned-engine ACK tests ran on `vmi1264463` at 04:01:22 UTC: eight failed
with `bind parameter index out of range: 1`; only the page-size guard passed.
The terminal log is `20260922-rainyforest-ack-native-initial.log` in the artifact
directory above. The engine evaluates compound-query LIMIT without bindings.
Local integration checkpoint `84f01e5c` renders only the validated integer page
bound and uses numbered bindings for mailbox values, retaining one statement,
the metadata row, overflow witness, and every existing assertion. A fresh rebuilt
binary passed all nine ACK tests at 04:08:06 UTC (0.674 seconds;
`20260922-rainyforest-ack-native-fresh.log`). An intervening rerun executed stale
code and is excluded: source bytes matched, but their preserved edit timestamp
preceded the completed baseline artifact. Refreshing that source timestamp
forced a real rebuild without changing bytes. Newer `8b6e0276` adds surviving staged Git
copies as a last-resort source of reply/extension metadata; this is merged for
the same combined gate. Formatting passes; the five-file UBS comparison against
`8b6e0276` exits 0 with zero new critical, 80 warning and seven informational
findings, all reviewed as test fixtures/assertions and formatting shifts. The
all-target check also exposed two incoming ACK test compile errors: pooled
connections lack `Debug`. Using `Outcome::expect` preserves the failure checks
without formatting the success value. Strict workspace/all-target Clippy with
warnings denied then passed at 04:19:07 UTC; the terminal receipt is
`20260922-rainyforest-combined-clippy-final.log`. The combined runtime run ended
at 05:08:15 UTC: 115/116 passed (11,611 outside selection; 110.807 seconds),
including both real stdio cases, nine ACK query tests, all 35 ACK worker tests
and 69 storage controls. The one failure occurred during a new staged fixture's
setup: libgit2 rejected a missing object when adding to a repository-owned index,
before reconciliation ran. The fixture now opens its index without an attached
object database and asserts the object is absent, so the original refusal and
preservation assertions can execute. The corrected test subsequently passed in
the 68-test run recorded below.
The failed terminal log remains `20260922-rainyforest-combined-runtime.log`;
the executed `am` SHA-256 was
`804383fc0242465041af0fdaa4054177dd6ec971011d4937a2b21af11d5d70a3`.
Publication remains pending. Upstream `2f7ee9ed` adds exhaustive ACK page-bound
regressions and retryable model discovery; those are the next fixed integration
cut. Search helper tests alone will not establish real-model loading coverage.

**Live search follow-through (`br-drpda`, closed):** tracing the imports
revealed that the newer discovery fix modified only the optional `search-core`
module. The mailbox actually uses DB `search_model2vec` and `search_auto_init`;
neither the loader's permanent negative cache nor the context's permanent
unavailable snapshot was repaired there. The DB path now has ordered fallback,
retryable failed discovery, stable successful model references, and lazy metadata
that lets the same context observe a later installation. Model I/O occurs outside
the context initialization lock. Initial metrics retain their historical meaning.
Seven deterministic controls were transferred manually and reviewed. A separate
opt-in subprocess regression requires actual registered potion artifacts, tests
the production cooldown and late installation behind a broken first cache, and
checks a normalized embedding plus stable context/model references. It is ignored
in ordinary model-free runs and must be explicitly executed for this bead's
closure. Tiny synthetic weights cannot qualify this path: the pinned dependency
correctly requires the registered artifact identity. The real model is present on
`vmi1264463`. Default workspace Clippy at 05:16:13 UTC did
not enable the optional `search-core` semantic module and predates these DB edits.
The current strict RCH gate explicitly enables that feature. The earlier cold
feature test job was cancelled before tests (exit 143, no verdict); its log is
retained. No model admission policy, runtime assertion or test threshold was
relaxed. This remains model-discovery/context qualification, not full semantic
transport or performance certification.

The frozen candidate passed all 68 selected tests through strict RCH on
`vmi1264463` at 08:00:51 UTC: 12 ACK scan, 19 live context, 15 live model-loader,
14 optional model-loader and eight staged-recovery tests (4,999 outside selection;
86.432 seconds). The registered-model subprocess passed in 33.464 seconds and
emitted its required completion marker. The missing-object fixture passed in
0.089 seconds. The receipt is `20260922-rainyforest-live-search-focused-tests-warm.log`
under the artifact directory above (SHA-256
`3299b38995d527cfcf85b3a29137fab46d5d3a1b2b4cc57a636d0bbe59d48f6d`).
The preceding 90-minute cold compilation timed out before tests and is excluded.
Metadata-only remote inspection confirmed all three test binaries were unchanged;
their hashes are retained in `20260922-rainyforest-live-search-test-elf.sha256`.
All 24 selected source/lock hashes matched the worker. Optional-feature workspace
Clippy passed at 06:11:16 UTC; final library timestamp invalidation and workspace
gates remain to be completed on the publication candidate.

Upstream subsequently advanced eight commits to `ae296364`, adding transactional
ACK admission, explorer pagination/privacy repairs, ATC reset/locking repairs and
optional-context promotion. These are the next fixed integration base; the
68-test result does not qualify their new behavior. A separate source audit found
that the legacy `SemanticBridge` can retain a 384-dimension index while the live
fast model emits 256 dimensions. Exact call sites were sent to GentleBeaver's
existing `br-kp1in.7` work (Mail 42841). This is a source finding awaiting a real
indexing/search reproducer, not a claim that full semantic transport now recovers.

Checkpoint `0c72bac5` preserves the live DB fix and the 68-test result. The
`ae296364` integration required manual formatting plus direct compiler/lint
repairs: ACK candidate coalescing now inserts a key before attempting admission
and removes it only for a stale delivery, retaining eligible siblings and bounded
error retries; fixture checkout uses `Outcome::expect`; optional context
publication uses equivalent lazy `map_or_else` branches and explicit unit
patterns. Strict RCH workspace/all-target Clippy with the optional search feature
and warnings denied passed at 08:28:14 UTC on `vmi1264463` (receipt
`20260922-rainyforest-ae296-clippy-final4.log`). The workspace/all-target compiler
check with the same feature passed at 08:37:31 UTC (475.871 seconds; receipt
`20260922-rainyforest-ae296-check.log`). The combined DB/storage/search-core
candidate passed 158/158 selected native tests at 08:59:07 UTC (4,935 outside
selection, 162.597 seconds after a 14m51s build). This includes 12 transactional
ACK admission tests, 12 ACK scans, 54 explorer helper/regression tests, 19 live
context tests, 15 live model tests, 24 optional-context tests, 14 optional-model
tests and eight staged-recovery controls. The registered-model subprocess passed
in 34.056 seconds with its completion marker. Receipt
`20260922-rainyforest-ae296-db-core-tests.log` has SHA-256
`34c97aa62cc5f37c29e397896e61d59c46c4147f7982aec14ed1a1887a25e4cd`;
metadata-only remote inspection identified three unchanged test executables,
with hashes in `20260922-rainyforest-ae296-test-elf.sha256`.

The server ACK-worker and ATC admission selection subsequently passed **59/59**
through strict RCH on the same worker at 11:46:40 UTC: 42 ACK-worker tests and
17 ATC admission tests, with 4,866 outside the selection. Run
`d0c9cc41-3b21-4101-b281-22b80ad24e78` took 47.582 seconds after a 117m31s cold
build. Receipt `20260922-rainyforest-ae296-server-only-tests.log` has SHA-256
`61983c9d1486b07bf02c34b69ad5c9176ddf7f9427337cf4183ebccd665b8763`.
The command was `cargo nextest run --locked --build-jobs 1 -j 1 --no-fail-fast
--success-output final -p mcp-agent-mail-server --lib -E
'test(ack_ttl::tests) | test(atc::admission_boundary_tests)'`, executed with
`RCH_WORKER=vmi1264463 RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec --` and 7,200-second build
and test limits. The executed server binary is recorded in
`20260922-rainyforest-server-test-elf.sha256`; all 29 recorded source/lock hashes
still match the worker. This brings the two current-source selections to 217
passing native tests, without claiming a full workspace or release gate.

The old default-feature target cache no longer contained the necessary compiled
artifacts. The initial command kept the prior four-package set for cache reuse,
but manifest/lock review then showed
that it needlessly built the CLI's embedded Beads engine and older async runtime.
That build was stopped before tests and the same two test-module selections were
narrowed to the server crate. An earlier combined server/optional-search attempt
was also cancelled before tests when feature unification forced a cold rebuild.
Both cancelled attempts have no runtime verdict; their logs are retained.
The final 13-file UBS comparison against the
incoming base exits 0 with zero new critical, 265 warning and 25 informational
findings. Warnings were reviewed as fixture assertions/setup, bounded cloning
and location diagnostics; exact test-only panic annotations preserve the
assertions. The full historical scan is still not a release clearance.

The live discovery/context bead is closed on this evidence, published in
`169143db` to main and its required mirror. The broader `br-8j6cb` recovery
acceptance remains open.

The next continuation reproduced the staged-metadata loss on `5a298c07` plus a
new regression, before changing production code. The first threaded message
repaired and repeated idempotently in fresh processes; the next message failed
because resetting the shared Git index had discarded its only reply metadata.
Strict RCH run `a1004463-1617-465f-9214-3486dfd081cb` failed that one test at
12:46:28 UTC on September 22. Its complete log and source receipt are retained
as `20260922-rainyforest-staged-initial-{reproducer.log,source.sha256}` under
`/data/projects/am-release-20260912`. The test's later ordinary-commit variant
was not reached in that failing run.

Archive commits now construct trees independently of the shared index. After a
successful commit, index maintenance holds Git's `index.lock` from observation
through atomic replacement, and updates only an index clean relative to that
commit's actual parent. Dirty, locked and invalid indexes stay byte-identical;
unrelated staged-only objects are excluded from the committed tree. Maintenance
failure warns without retrying an already-durable commit. A busy lock can leave
the index stale, so this does not promise clean status after every concurrent
commit.

The corrected selection passed **80/80** tests on strict RCH `vmi1264463`, run
`24ddec7d-0776-442d-a05d-8565c9ab3f11`, terminal 12:56:03 UTC, 28.730 seconds
runtime, 5,015 tests outside selection. The real-Git regression repairs six
staged-only replies in separate processes, both with and without an earlier
ordinary archive commit. It verifies exact reply/extension metadata, BCC
redaction, body and committed bytes, retained evidence and idempotence. Another
regression crosses three commit strategies with clean, staged, locked and
corrupt indexes, including rejected-path preservation. Existing recovery and
commit concurrency controls also pass. The six processes establish evidence
survival beyond a four-repair batch's lifetime; they do not exercise the actual
batch cursor or transport backlog. Journal-enqueue failure, backlog exhaustion,
interrupted transport recovery and independent review remain open acceptance.
The fixed log is `20260922-rainyforest-staged-fixed-tests.log`, SHA-256
`be5d7943065d25ad72bcbc8f6b21d21035417052de21ca2e108aed1c01542b90`.

The fix was published in `7352a3d3`; its source bytes match that passing run.
Workspace/all-target `cargo check` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, both with
`--features mcp-agent-mail-search-core/hybrid`, passed through strict RCH at
13:00:04 and 13:03:31 UTC respectively. Formatting and whitespace checks pass.
A metadata-only RCH invocation confirmed the tested storage executable remains
fresh; its hash is retained in `20260922-rainyforest-staged-test-elf.sha256`,
alongside matching local and worker source receipts. The two-file UBS comparison
against `5a298c07` exits 0 with zero new critical, 107 warning and 17 information
findings. Reviewed warnings cover fixture assertions/setup, bounded fixture
cloning, line-shifted existing tests, private scratch writes and header indexing
protected by a checked 12-byte slice. No new suppressions or assertion changes
were needed. An initial check invocation was refused before execution because
its nextest-specific jobs flag did not constrain Cargo; the corrected `-j 1`
invocation passed. There was no local build fallback or full-release claim.

RainyForest read all 1,350 lines of current AGENTS.md and 2,053 lines of README.md.
The current vision, durability, threat, browser and ATC contracts were compared
with source, the verification ledger, dependency upgrade log, previous full
plan/spec audit and tracker. Historical plan/spec coverage is reused explicitly;
this is not a claim that every historical document was freshly reread. The prior
assessment's conclusions were challenged against newer source and terminal
artifacts, rather than inherited as present truth.

- Source inspected: `17be6b647049d8a775661a2737c59466932665fc`, main. The only
  initially dirty tracked files were the two Beads JSONL files. No production
  source was edited or shared mailbox repaired in this assessment.
- Live GitHub API: latest public release **v0.3.36**, published September 16 at
  10:14:19 UTC, 15 assets. Publication is not a verdict on current main. Local
  `am --version` is also 0.3.36, SHA-256
  `e6cf98a365fae0d569d865e3f43e1068153191bb18641d663fbf4803705e77a7`.
  Version equality alone does not establish identical source or release assets.
- Important correction: `br-l1q6z` is **closed with a later full green run**.
  Its September 16 terminal receipt reports 17,547 tests passed, zero failed,
  36 excluded, zero passing-leaky. Inspected retained
  `all-eleven-fixes-full-workspace-vmi1227854.{log,result.json,source.json}` in
  `/data/projects/am-release-20260912`; exit 0 and `source_stable=true`.
  This predates the current 0.4.4 runtime migration. Do not reopen that historical
  restoration task merely because a newer candidate needs qualification.
- More recent selected evidence is also real: inspected terminal logs show
  3,335 DB/schema/search tests passed with seven skips on September 19, and
  3,392 FTUI/console tests passed with 1,578 tests outside that selection.
  Logs are `044-runtime-pin-db-broad-quiet-extract.log` and
  `044-ftui-070-runtime-resumed.log` in the same artifact directory. These are
  retained executions, not fresh runs performed by this assessment.
- At assessment start, whole-workspace Clippy had **NO_VERDICT**:
  the preceding continuation hit a Cargo `color_quant` source-cache panic on
  hz2, then a 1,800-second remote build timeout on vmi1264463, then a capacity
  refusal. The later terminal workspace passes above supersede that state and
  close `br-g2ip0`. Focused passes cannot certify later merged source. No local
  build fallback was used.
- Fresh live coordination succeeded: message 42750 persisted with both named
  recipients; its delivery receipt explicitly says no signal or acknowledgment
  witnessed. Plan reservation 11785 was granted without conflict. This proves
  a bounded live path, not every tool or disaster recovery.
- Fresh live MCP health returned `status=ok`, **health_level=red**. Critical
  integrity/connectivity verdicts were green; pressure was red. WBQ p95 was
  1,047 ms and commit-queue p95 4,195 ms. Current pressure classification has
  a 250 ms red queue threshold, so empty queues and the separate 15-second
  coalescer degradation threshold do not make this contradictory or healthy.
  Archive/DB message counts were 42,144/42,173 within configured tolerance;
  that is not row-level parity proof. This observation is not a benchmark.
- Local `am doctor health` exited 1 with `local_config_unattested`, one orphan
  page in its private probe and 32 reservation-field differences. That is a
  different, unattested target; do not merge it with the live integrity verdict.
- Initial tracker: **44 open + 92 in progress + 13 blocked = 149 unfinished**,
  plus 2,359 closed. Assignees and in-progress flags are not proof of current
  activity. CASS health reports a stale index; no fresh session-search coverage
  is claimed. Recent git, actual artifacts and Beads comments supply history.

### Architecture and numbered vision checklist

The native CLI/server drive FastMCP stdio/HTTP handlers and shared tools/resources.
Tools use the SQLModel pool and FrankenSQLite runtime for canonical operational
rows, then feed Git archival and search indexing. Core owns configuration,
models, metrics and safety contracts; storage owns archive/coalescing; guard and
share are separate consumers. Server supplies the TUI and authenticated HTML
mail UI; CLI adds setup, robot, doctor and native E2E/bench runners. This is a
12-member workspace, with the public dashboard replay built separately.

Runtime is Asupersync 0.5 / SQLModel 0.5 / patched FrankenSQLite 0.4.4; embedded
Beads retains a separate patched 0.3.18 engine. Canonical C SQLite remains a
verification/recovery exception, not the runtime mailbox. FrankenSearch and
FastMCP are now immutable Git pins; the old gated sibling-clone story is stale.

`PARTIAL` means real implementation with incomplete acceptance or known gaps.
`UNPROVEN` does not mean absent. A live sampled path is deliberately narrower
than whole-family certification. Paths below are relative to `crates/` unless
otherwise stated. Existing implementation/test pairs are retained.

| # | Testable promise | Source and actual status | Remaining acceptance / Beads |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 45 tools and 25 resource contracts | tools modules and server registration are real; protocol upgrade PARTIAL | `br-s3xbp`, `br-w9v59.1`, conformance at final candidate |
| 2 | Explicit send/reply/read/ack and durable receipts | `tools/src/messaging.rs`; fresh persisted send WORKING within that sample | `br-kp1in.1/.2`, identity/recipient reconciliation across restart |
| 3 | Broadcast always refused | messaging normalization and handler both reject it; implemented | Preserve negative transport coverage; no broadcast feature |
| 4 | Reliable DB-to-Git convergence | Bounded background reconciliation now wired for HTTP/TUI/stdio; real idle stdio recovery passes; PARTIAL | `br-8j6cb`, `br-kp1in.2/.9/.10`; broader failure/restart qualification |

| 10 | Product membership and build-slot coordination | `tools/src/products.rs`, `build_slots.rs` are implemented | `br-kp1in.1/.2`; scope/TTL tests, advisory slots are not mutexes |
| 11 | Bare am and automatic agent setup | CLI startup and core setup real; authority races remain PARTIAL | `br-49eak`, `br-siq0z`, `br-db75q`, `br-fphbm`, `br-7znpo` |
| 12 | Safe credentials and client configuration | Real token/config logic and hardening, still PARTIAL | `br-ww5js`, `br-x5a8y`, `br-q8k82`, `br-6u4hx`, `br-x2jf5` |

| 14 | Authenticated web mail and usable share/export | Real `mail_ui.rs` and share crypto/snapshot modules; current full UNPROVEN | `br-ji2f0`, real HTTP/auth/export tamper lanes |
| 15 | Fast truthful robot/doctor health | Implemented; fresh health explains red pressure; performance PARTIAL | `br-es9fm`, `br-eru3j`, health latency task, `br-kp1in.5/.6` |
| 16 | Reversible owner-safe doctor | Real mutation/undo machinery; latest backup/writer fixes unqualified together | `br-qfvd6`, `br-qdgio`, `br-r6psd`, `br-sd3md`, recovery owner tests |
| 17 | Search-as-you-type and scoped Search V3 | Real lexical/private-snapshot/optional hybrid routes; PARTIAL | `br-7x5fm`, `br-eh8bj`, `br-kp1in.7/.8`; retain safe SQL fallback |
| 18 | Real optional model/TOON quality | Implemented selected paths; TOON retained real tests improve prior picture | `br-kp1in.7/.8`; actual model/encoder and privacy/relevance controls |

| 20 | Signed install/update on supported targets | v0.3.36 published; installer/source pin logic real; acceptance PARTIAL | `br-nq2kb`, `br-bx73n`, installer and platform owners |
| 21 | Lossless Python import and explicit cutover | Legacy code implemented; namespace/publication cases PARTIAL | `br-lkhxw`, `br-dbt24`, `br-1m1tv`, `br-ajiq8` |
| 22 | Complete current correctness and reproducible release gate | Older full green exists; current candidate UNPROVEN | `br-5lgwn`, `br-g2ip0`, `br-kp1in.3/.4`, `br-bx73n` |
| 23 | Measured operational latency/resource budgets | Bench infrastructure real; current general claims UNPROVEN | `br-kp1in.5/.6`, stress tasks; no historical-number extrapolation |
| 24 | Honest active docs and deliberate distribution scope | Current README boundaries much improved; VISION/old tasks conflict | `br-4meup`, `br-95spu`, `br-ajiq8`; reconcile authority without deleting history |
| 25 | Privacy-safe public WASM replay | Standalone real screen/replay exists; deployment not reverified here | `br-f9avw.10`, `br-mq9q1`; live browser mirror stays deferred |

No entirely uncovered feature family was found. The backlog already covers the
goals, but literal completion of stale descriptions would **not** finish them.
Examples: `br-kp1in.3` still describes mtime selection although current
`read_incident_scorecard` consumes exact producer identity/digest; `br-ku0kl`
describes an obsolete sibling clone; `br-yzk37` calls knobs inert despite engine
implementations now present. These need current acceptance, not duplicate code.
Project-addressed mailboxes and session-bound identity remain explicit future
requests, not prerequisites silently added to today's trusted-local contract.

### Bridge: smallest coherent route to the promised product

1. **Finish the current candidate, not another dependency campaign (M).**
   `br-5lgwn` owns final combined-runtime qualification; `br-g2ip0` owns outstanding
   compiler/lint verification. Use one admitted RCH build lane with a frozen
   source/lock/features manifest, then reuse its artifacts for focused and full
   gates. Classify each of the 36 older exclusions under the new engine; do not
   silently carry obsolete trigger/concurrency excuses or count exclusions green.
   Preserve original failures and watchdogs. Source fixes are not deployed fixes.
2. **Close accepted-message recovery and publication gaps (M–L, critical).**
   Promote `br-8j6cb` from P3: an accepted DB row must eventually regain its
   canonical, sender and recipient archive records after a failed queue/journal
   and restart, even if no client reads/retries it. Wire the existing bounded
   reconciliation worker into stdio; retain its authority and no-clobber checks.
   Recovery/path/snapshot owners retain their scopes. Prove real positive repair
   and no-clobber/scope negatives, not merely a safe refusal.
3. **Complete one coherent real user history (L).** `br-kp1in.1/.2/.9/.10`
   join messaging, contacts/products, leases, quiet ATC, cancellation and restart.
   Begin with bounded smoke; then controlled faults on private fixtures; only
   then the already-specified 24-hour/two-host profiles. Track committed versus
   returned versus archived state separately; a timeout is initially unknown.
   Require row/recipient witnesses and bounded resource growth, not equal counts.
4. **Make performance explain the observed route (M).** `br-kp1in.5/.6`
   report queue latency, archive lag, pressure, tool deadlines, RSS/FDs and
   retry amplification together. Empty queues must not erase observed latency.
   Keep absolute budget breaches when comparative controls are inadmissible.
   Profile current health/global-search routes before changing algorithms or
   weakening thresholds; preserve private-snapshot SQL fallback correctness.
5. **Qualify the exact executable and gate publication (M).** Scorecard producer
   binding already exists; finish its adversarial tests and actual manual
   publisher consumer (`br-kp1in.3/.4`, `br-nq2kb`, `br-bx73n`). Require explicit
   installed parity, selected real-path suites and native target evidence.
   Shipping, signatures and full default tests are three different conclusions.
   Do not enable Actions or publish a test release for this assessment.
6. **Independent user-surface lanes (S–M each).** Finish setup/config authority,
   legacy import/reopen, interactive TUI, optional dependency quality and share
   export with existing owners. Optional model absence cannot certify that model
   or block an explicitly lexical-only candidate. Preserve all existing features.
7. **Reconcile active promises (S).** `br-4meup` must resolve VISION's automatic
   stale-process killing, no-C-SQLite, byte-for-byte prose, zero ignored tests,
   and deferred-web statements against newer governing contracts. Preserve the
   goal and date the supersession; do not weaken safety or invent acceptance to
   make old checkboxes true. Product decisions remain `br-ajiq8`/`br-95spu`.

Implementation does not wait for an audit epic. The genuine dependency chain is
candidate fixes → combined gates → real sustained/installed acceptance → release.
Harness, measurement and adversarial-test development can proceed independently;
certification waits on product correctness. No new architecture or tracker is
needed. Exact Bead refinements and final graph validation follow below.

### September 21 plan refinement record

Phase 3a and Phase 5 use the frozen prompts retained verbatim below. The existing
implementation/test graph is regenerated by updating its current evidence and
acceptance rather than duplicating its issues. No implementation or release
closure is credited to this assessment.

**Ambition round 1: recovery without a helpful client.** A read-triggered healer
alone does not close the archive promise: a message may never be read again.
Require bounded startup/background reconciliation after transient archive failure
and restart, with no client read or retry. An idempotent retry skips one-time
archive dispatch by design, so it cannot be assumed to repair the missing copy.
Keep source DB durability and eventual Git convergence as separate assertions.
Do not attempt recovery of bytes no authoritative source retains. Companion
tests must prove actual repaired artifacts, not only a logged degradation.

**Ambition round 2: bounded progress under sustained contention.** Successful
eventual retries can hide overload. Extend existing measurements to report
offered, admitted, committed, replied and reconciled operations; attempt count
and oldest outstanding age accompany percentiles. Bound the reconciliation
backlog by work scheduling, not by dropping accepted DB truth. Sweep load until
saturation on an owned fixture, then show recovery after load removal. Measure
FD/RSS slopes and cold initialization separately from steady state. An admission
refusal is a distinct outcome, never a fast successful operation. This improves
the existing workload and performance pairs without a new telemetry subsystem.

**Ambition round 3: separate transaction order from eventual convergence.** The
existing bounded history checker should use partial-order constraints for
transactional message/recipient/idempotency operations, with explicit barriers
and durable witnesses for ambiguous responses. Archive convergence uses a
different predicate after an admitted bounded drain; it must not be forced into
an invented synchronous Git contract. Partition independent histories only while
retaining cross-project global ID and recovery-generation constraints. Show a
minimal counterexample for duplicate/lost rows or wrong-generation repair;
exhaustion is NO_VERDICT. This is a useful application of history checking, not
a new general model-checking framework or a universal correctness proof.

Bead regeneration updated `br-kp1in.2/.3/.5/.9` and the existing product,
migration and documentation tasks. The initial frozen instruction remains
unchanged; improvements are embedded in the Beads, not only this document.

**Refinement 1 — scope and source:** corrected obsolete dependency/scorecard
assumptions, retained the legitimately closed older full gate, and left all
ownership/status claims intact. Updated `br-ku0kl` with the current immutable
dependency graph; its old sibling-clone title must not trigger duplicate work.

**Refinement 2 — preserved behavior and test realism:** extended existing
companions `.6` and `.10` with independently calculated accounting controls,
no-client-trigger reconciliation, wrong-generation and missing-byte cases.
Archive-only recovery cannot invent metadata it never stored. All existing
scope/contact/identity, advisory-slot and broadcast-refusal assertions remain.

**Refinement 3 — evidence:** inspected the retained full-gate terminal result and
source manifest plus selected DB/FTUI terminal summaries, and updated `br-bx73n`.
The released, locally installed, live-daemon and source candidates remain
distinct. No recreated wrapper or inferred current pass substitutes for a
terminal result; the old red count is explicitly superseded.

**Refinement 4 — dependency order:** the existing workflow certification task
`.2` had no dependency on the remaining archive convergence acceptance. Added
exactly `br-kp1in.2 -> br-8j6cb` (the former depends on the latter). Test authoring
need not wait, but certification cannot close while accepted messages still
require luck or a client request to regain their recovery archive. The repair
itself does not wait on the history checker, avoiding a cycle. Retained all
other implementation/test pairings and assignees.

**Refinement 5 — convergence:** reread the current 25-goal matrix and revised
Beads against the original promises. No further scope, acceptance, priority or
dependency change was needed. All literal issue IDs resolve; no issues were
added or removed. This assessment changed 11 existing issues, with no status or
assignee changes; the pre-existing `br-g2ip0` blocked-status update is also present
in the shared JSONL diff. `br dep cycles --json` reports zero active cycles.
Final `bv --robot-triage` reports 149 unfinished, 124 actionable and 25 not
actionable; actionable includes owned work and is not permission to claim it.
`br sync --flush-only` completed. `git diff --check` passed.

The assessment-only UBS invocation returned **exit 3: no supported languages,
nothing scanned** for Markdown/JSONL. It was not a pass, and those changes were
initially left uncommitted. The subsequent implementation received the complete
Rust baseline comparison and triage recorded above; `UBS_ALLOW_NO_SCAN` was never
enabled. Neither an unsupported-language result nor a patch comparison proves
that the complete release gate is green.

### Requested-work and honesty disposition

Window: the September 21 reality-check request only. The creation-gate consumer
is the user explicitly requesting this assessment; the decision is where to
direct implementation effort. Observed defects justifying it are the stale red
gate narrative, obsolete dependency tasks and under-prioritized missing archive
convergence. This section retires as active guidance at the next assessment;
history is retained, never deleted. Running product code does not branch on it.
The integrity-control exception is unnecessary because the request supplies the
gate. Highest-value ready capability work is stable path authority (`br-xzgcj`)
and archive convergence (`br-8j6cb`); another hour implementing those would offer
more runtime value than extending this already complete requested assessment.

Real-work inventory: **zero USER implementations, zero ENABLER implementations,
one PROCESS assessment with its associated tracker updates**. There is no new
feature to demonstrate; fresh live sends/receipts exercise existing capability.
Without this work the binaries would be identical, but the requested steering
would still rely on obsolete status. The long-standing corruption/recovery work
remains important; this window served the explicit assessment request. No swarm
was dispatched, no close count used as progress, no original acceptance split
off to permit closure. Disposition: bounded requested process, zero runtime
credit; stop planning and hand the existing implementation graph back to owners.

Honesty inventory (solo review, not independent certification):

1. No tests weakened/deleted/ignored (checked: only plan/JSONL changes).
2. No doubles introduced (checked: no code/test changes).
3. No goldens regenerated (checked: no fixture changes).
4. No gate/validator relaxation (checked: no workflow/config changes; UBS's
   suggested no-scan override was not used).
5. No gate gaming (checked: all acceptance remains open; no publication).
6. No zero-run green (checked: retained terminal counts, UBS explicitly no scan).
7. No unrun-test claim (checked: retained versus fresh probes distinguished;
   historical plan/spec audit reuse and unavailable current full gate disclosed).
8. No lower-grade evidence promoted (checked: source presence, earlier tests,
   live persisted receipt and released assets each retain their own scope).
9. Corrected the previous assessment's obsolete red-test conclusion in place;
   retained actual later green and current NO_VERDICT without projecting a count.
10. No stderr suppression used for cited evidence (checked: tool output and
    retained logs; truncated display output was not treated as a complete read).
11. No unmet task closed (checked: IDs/statuses and assignees preserved).
12. No spec weakened to fit code (checked: historical contradictions are assigned
    to the existing docs task; safety/quality requirements remain intact).
13–16. No delegated agents or delegated closures in this window; historical
    peer receipts inspected as retained evidence, not independently rerun.
17. No peer agreement counted as proof (checked: evidence comes from code,
    terminal artifacts, API observations and tracker, not endorsement).
18. No postselected performance denominator (checked: no performance win claim;
    retained test totals and exclusions are shown together).
19. Explainable limits: broad tool output can truncate, so neither `cat` alone
    nor earlier audit reuse means every historical document was freshly read.
    CASS's stale index precluded a claimed fresh history survey. The requested
    AGENTS and README were read completely before assessment. The initial UBS
    landing limitation and subsequent scoped triage are recorded above; no
    permission or repair request is hidden behind a success claim.
20. Strongest evidence: the inspected September 16 terminal full-gate receipt,
    the exact current archive failure/replay paths, fresh persisted message
    receipt and reproducible plan/Beads graph diff. These support the assessment,
    not a claim that the remaining product gaps are fixed.

Countermeasure for stale/overbroad success or failure reporting: keep exact
candidate, selected scope and terminal evidence attached to every conclusion;
no planning revision may stand in for product
delivery (RH-10). No fresh CASS-wide retrospective honesty sweep is claimed.

**Handoff:** assessment, bridge, initial Bead refinement, three ambition rounds,
regeneration and five refinement passes are complete within the stated evidence
limits. No new issues, runtime edits, default changes, release, or live repair.
Resume the existing candidate/recovery/archive lanes; do not launch another
assessment to avoid their remaining implementation work.

## Historical September 8 assessment (superseded)

**Current assessment: September 8, 2026 — requested complete reality check.**
This assessment supersedes the September 4 and September 2 assessments retained
below. The audit began at `ba2ad9ce`; peer changes subsequently advanced the code
through `4717f869`. Released v0.3.34 is still `0125f050`. These are different
subjects of verification.

## September 8 judgment

**The core product is real and useful; reliable operation under contention and
strict release acceptance are unfinished.** This is no longer a missing-server
or empty-command problem. Actual released binaries can register agents, reserve
paths, send/read/ack/reply, serve resources, and enforce the archive-backed guard.
However, a fresh execution of the canonical workflow failed its concurrent HTTP
phase, the last complete workspace run had 12 failures, and manual publication
did not satisfy the documented zero-failure gate. Those facts outweigh the large
number of closed issues when deciding whether the project is finished.

The highest return comes from delivering already-tested isolated repairs,
resolving the remaining database/recovery failures, and making the existing
release and workflow machinery decisive. Another architecture, dashboard,
replacement engine, or broad feature campaign would dilute that work.

### Evidence and its limits

- Read all 1,339 lines of `AGENTS.md` and all initial 1,993 lines of `README.md`.
  Read the subsequent 15-line README addition for the newly landed guard bounds.
  Reviewed the existing full September 4 vision/plan audit, current documentation
  index, durability contract, verification realism/closure policy and release
  gates. Compared plan/spec documentation since the earlier assessment: only
  this bridge changed before the concurrent README addition. Historical document
  reads and measurements are reused explicitly; they are not new executions.
- Initial tracker inventory: **2,457 issues: 2,289 closed, 90 open, 77 in progress,
  one blocked**. Thus 168 unfinished issues, not 90. `bv` reported 155 actionable
  and 13 not actionable; actionable does not mean unowned. Its top suggestion
  was an old mirror-sync task, demonstrating why graph ranking needs source and
  release evidence before taking action.
- Live GitHub API confirmed v0.3.34 public, published September 8 at 02:58:05 UTC,
  with 25 uploaded assets. Prior retained receipts establish six target families,
  signed public downloads, Bash install/update, Homebrew formula publication and
  dual-architecture GHCR publication. Linux ARM execution used QEMU; Intel Mac
  used Rosetta. A fresh full PowerShell installer and `brew install` were not
  executed. Every active crate remains `publish = false`; crates.io is an explicit
  product decision (`br-95spu`), not a venue silently completed by this release.
- Full nextest receipt at source `43459c5a`, run
  `f70dd3fe-fc26-4d85-a6aa-a1dcc3aaf19c`: **17,384 executed, 17,372 passed,
  12 failed, 37 skipped, two passing tests reported leaky**, exit 100. Raw log
  SHA-256 `265e326d0a11f1c8ab66f31ffa0d41f62f840c85bd023aa888323ec0ea890d48`.
  Final release-source check, Clippy with warnings denied, formatting and 123
  focused tests passed. Neither result validates the later peer commits or
  changes the red full-suite verdict.
- **Fresh published-binary workflow, 19:19:23–19:20:09 UTC:** 41 assertions passed,
  one failed, zero skipped. Phases 1–8 passed. Phase 9 completed HTTP initialize,
  send, inbox and ack, then RedFox's concurrent `register_agent` returned
  `RESOURCE_BUSY` / `busy_retryable`; the client exited before the ready barrier.
  The other two clients were terminated by the owned harness and the server
  exited 0. The reopen portion was not reached. This is a real failed workflow,
  not evidence of lost mail or a proven new engine regression. The server calls
  the error recoverable; the fixture currently requires first-attempt success.
  That acceptance mismatch must be resolved explicitly, with bounded retry and
  durable identity checks if retry is the intended contract.
- That fresh run used release `am` SHA-256
  `5931c453048d78154046865986a2c274e6189cc53714e418967b77b38f0785c7` and server
  SHA-256 `687d5569130a7366cfe2abad2b6510ceec2acf8d618b49e9dab34c282aa94f20`.
  Both workflow script and common harness hashes match the frozen source manifest.
  The earlier 42/42 run remains valid for its own invocation; it cannot erase
  this failure. No retry-until-green loop was run.
- Local `timeout 15s am doctor health` returned 124 after reporting
  `local_config_unattested` and migration work on its private probe copy. This is
  no health verdict about the shared mailbox. The separate authoritative
  reservation snapshot was conflict-free and lease 9572 was granted for this
  document. No shared-mailbox repair or process takeover was attempted.
- Keyword and Rust AST scans found no `todo!()` or `unimplemented!()` calls in
  `crates`. Real handlers and known failures are stronger evidence than this
  absence. Explicit model/encoder substitutes remain proof limitations, not
  missing implementations inferred from a keyword.

Evidence roots: local/CSS `/data/projects/am-release-0334-artifacts-20260908`;
fresh execution on CSS under `reality-check-0908-7_egxbm3/` with the terminal
`final-release-workflow-receipt.json`, full stdout and each client's stderr and
history. Published release: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail_rust/releases/tag/v0.3.34.

### Vision checklist: present capability, remaining gap, owner

`WORKING` below is bounded to the named executed path. `PARTIAL` includes known
integration defects. `UNPROVEN` means the required current proof is absent, not
that implementation is absent. No whole-product completion percentage is used.

| # | Promise from README / governing contracts | Current assessment | Remaining work and existing coverage |
|---|---|---|---|

| 4 | Broadcast intentionally forbidden | Implemented refusal and tests at both normalization/tool boundaries | Preserve rejection at `messaging.rs:1136,1891`; no broadcast feature task. |
| 5 | DB commit plus durable Git recovery ledger | PARTIAL: real persistence/archive pipeline and offline parity pass | `br-0flbu`, `br-htobc`, `br-kp1in.1/.2/.9/.10`, `br-8j6cb`; eventual archive is not synchronous commit. |
| 6 | Concurrent agents without wedges or corruption | PARTIAL: fresh three-client identity contention failed workflow | `br-kp1in.1/.2`, `br-22gm3`, `br-qz7rz`, `br-fkam4`, `br-9bwnb`; retain retry/cancellation histories. |
| 7 | Recover corrupt state without false health or source loss | PARTIAL; multiple full-suite failures; new source recovery fix `ad87cdb8` | `br-qdgio`, `br-r6psd`, `br-sd3md`, `br-kp1in.12`, `br-l1q6z`; validate new promotion behavior, not just a refusal. |
| 8 | FrankenSQLite runtime and structured async | Real fsqlite 0.3.18/asupersync 0.4.9; lifecycle guarantee PARTIAL | Canonical SQLite remains verification/recovery only. `br-tl2sg`, `br-22gm3`, engine probes; no policy/default reversal. |
| 9 | Scoped identities, contacts and durable topics | PARTIAL; identity sequential pass, concurrent Busy; new source contact repair `708ae6ba` | `contacts.rs`, `macros.rs`; `br-g6c0z`, `br-sgaee`, `br-qayvs`, current conformance gate. |
| 10 | Reservations, TTL/release and commit/push guard | WORKING for fresh offline lifecycle/guard; broader bounds PARTIAL | New source guard `4717f869` is not in release; `br-ssog9`, `br-l1q6z`; preserve advisory semantics. |
| 11 | Product bus and advisory build slots | Real handlers, current complete behavior UNPROVEN | Existing mixed workflow and conformance; `br-kp1in.1/.2`; membership/privacy and expiry remain acceptance. |
| 12 | Useful 16-screen TUI | Real implementation; current visual/interaction proof PARTIAL | `br-boq46`, `br-y8k4z`, `br-mljnz`, full TUI traversal; snapshots are not live input proof. |
| 13 | Web mailbox/archive review | PARTIAL; two archive HTTP failures and static-export failure | `mail_ui.rs:71` opens DB before archive dispatch; validated isolated routing repair remains unlanded under `br-l1q6z`. |
| 14 | Robot snapshots and noninteractive CLI | WORKING for sampled agents/list; broader truth PARTIAL | `robot.rs`; `br-4myjj`, `br-eru3j`, `br-49eak`; recheck stale titles before reimplementing fixes. |
| 15 | Reversible, scoped, owner-safe doctor | PARTIAL; real seven-op mutation/undo machinery, failed integrity cases | `doctor/mutate.rs`, `br-x2jf5`, `br-6u4hx`, recovery tasks; local unattested timeout is not live health. |
| 16 | Agent setup, config authority and secret safety | PARTIAL; substantial real integration and unfinished authority tasks | `br-siq0z`, `br-ww5js`, `br-q8k82`, `br-3cqr4`, `br-x5a8y`, `br-fphbm`. |
| 17 | Search V3 lexical and optional hybrid | Real integration; route/quality coverage PARTIAL | `search_service.rs`; `br-7x5fm`, `br-ku0kl`, `br-eh8bj`, `br-kp1in.7/.8`; portable release is lexical. |
| 18 | Useful optional summaries and compact output | PARTIAL; offline substitutes cannot establish model/encoder quality | `br-kp1in.7/.8`; actual selected model/encoder, scope canaries and semantic round trip required. |
| 19 | ATC learning with quiet, safe defaults | PARTIAL; fresh default-disabled workflow; learning test still red | `br-hwney`, `br-au76r`, `br-kp1in.1/.2`; isolated enabled fixture fix is not file-backed restart proof. |
| 20 | Share/export encryption and hosted verification | Real crypto/bundle code; complete current hosted path UNPROVEN | `share/src`, `br-ji2f0`, security/share real-path gates; no synthetic-only closure. |
| 21 | Signed installation/update and all supported venues | WORKING within retained platform/install/update scopes; release acceptance PARTIAL | GitHub/Homebrew/GHCR delivered; `br-bx73n`, `br-nq2kb`, `br-kp1in.3/.4`; native installer gaps disclosed. |
| 22 | Lossless legacy import and deliberate old-repo cutover | PARTIAL; source import/reopen fixes and unresolved authority tasks | `br-dbt24`, `br-lkhxw`, `br-mrfhc`, `br-p4s42`, `br-ajiq8`; no inferred cutover/deletion. |
| 23 | Current complete correctness and installed parity | PARTIAL: retained 12-red full run; later source has no new full verdict here | `br-l1q6z`, `br-bx73n`; ignored installed parity must run explicitly with exact paths. |
| 24 | Measured latency/resource budgets | UNPROVEN at current candidate/load; dated baselines only | `br-kp1in.5/.6`, `br-eru3j`, `br-y8k4z`; report workload, route, errors and resource growth with latency. |
| 25 | Honest docs and explicit public replay/browser boundary | PARTIAL; replay deliberately sanitized, live browser mirror deferred | `br-4meup`, `br-f9avw/.10`, `br-mq9q1`; stale gate/topology prose must not redefine current scope. |

**Would completing the existing backlog close the gaps?** It covers every
identified goal at the capability-family level. No new untracked feature family
was found in this refresh. But completing stale task descriptions literally
would not finish the project: some still call for Actions, claim absent containers,
or ask for already-landed scorecard code, while strict manual publication and
concurrent retry acceptance need explicit current criteria. Revise those existing
issues rather than create a second backlog. Implementation plus current real-path
acceptance closes bounded promises; it cannot prove universal zero deadlocks,
corruption or future performance.

## September 8 bridge and execution order

1. **Deliver the small existing repairs (S–M, highest immediate return).** Under
   `br-l1q6z`, review the isolated archive-routing, polling, environment and ATC
   fixtures against current main, reserve their paths, resolve drift, and land
   only reviewed changes. Archive dispatch must work from actual committed Git
   content with unusable DB configuration, retaining auth/method/path checks.
   Polling must return bounded errors without weakening cancellation semantics.
   `br-ue7e5` similarly retains the tested CORS `Vary` repair. Prior candidate
   passes are evidence to reuse, not proof of current delivery. Do not project a
   reduced full-suite failure count from focused tests.
2. **Finish database/recovery correctness (M–L, critical path).** Classify each of
   the 12 retained failures, distinguish fixture authority from physical integrity,
   and validate new recovery commit `ad87cdb8`. Preserve corruption negatives,
   same-process writer exclusion, hot-WAL truth, stable generation and no-clobber
   promotion. `br-kp1in.12` stays blocked until its snapshot semantics work with
   the actual runtime engine. Engine-level minimal reproductions remain separate
   from application workaround proof; do not silently swap the runtime engine.
3. **Make multi-process workflows meet their actual retry contract (M).** Extend
   `br-kp1in.1/.2` from the retained failed three-client registration. Choose and
   document whether first-attempt registration must succeed or bounded Busy retry
   is supported. If retry is allowed, retain every error and attempt, reuse the
   requested identity, prove one durable identity/profile, cap elapsed time and
   attempts, and complete the send/reopen/archive assertions. A fixed-delay
   rerun-until-green or suppressing `isError` does not count.
4. **Finish child/resource lifetime bounds (S–M).** `br-tl2sg` owns the detached
   stdout reader in `run_tmux_bounded`: caller timeout does not stop `read_to_end`
   when a descendant holds the pipe. Include real descendant and sustained-output
   fixtures, bounded memory, cleanup/join evidence and repeated-probe thread/FD
   counts. Keep large finite output and unavailable-pane behavior; no unsafe code.
5. **Connect current release gates to manual publication (M).** Keep Actions
   disabled. `br-nq2kb` must gate the DSR/manual path, using `br-kp1in.3/.4`'s
   existing candidate-bound code and `br-bx73n`'s installed parity/reliability
   receipts. Deliberately red lint/test, absent required suite, wrong binary and
   incomplete producer must prevent the local publish transition. A signed asset
   proves provenance, not correctness. No retroactive green release claim and no
   deletion/replacement of published assets.
6. **Earn sustained reliability and performance claims (L).** Complete the
   existing mixed histories `.1/.2/.9/.10` before the proposed 24-hour/two-host
   workload; the smoke must first complete. Use `.5/.6` to measure actual routes,
   offered/completed rates, p95/p99, queue occupancy, errors, memory/FD/disk and
   archive lag. A/A and paired windows matter for comparative claims; absolute
   budget misses remain visible even if comparisons have no verdict. Do not turn
   a historical gauntlet into a universal safety guarantee.
7. **Finish selected optional and user surfaces (M–L, independent lanes).**
   `.7/.8` require real selected dependency evidence. TUI input, scoped web/share,
   setup secrets and legacy import keep their existing owners and strong tests.
   Optional hybrid/LLM is not a hidden dependency of a lexical-only release.
8. **Reconcile the documentation last (S).** `br-4meup` must distinguish working,
   shipped, tested and deferred. Replace stale topology and absolutist claims
   with dated boundaries while preserving the actual goals. The root historical
   TODO's checked boxes are not present-day correctness certificates.

No implementation task waits on a new audit epic. Existing implementation/test
pairs remain `.1/.2`, `.3/.4`, `.5/.6`, `.7/.8`, `.9/.10`. Causal product repairs
can proceed while tests are authored; only certification waits on their result.

## September 8 skill execution and granular TODO

The frozen Phase 3a and Phase 5 instructions retained verbatim in the September 4
record below are applied again to the current gaps. Existing self-contained
Beads are the generated work graph: regeneration updates their current evidence,
implementation/test requirements and dependencies instead of duplicating them.

- [x] Read complete AGENTS and README; inspect later README/source drift.
- [x] Read skill and references; compare current contracts with prior full audit.
- [x] Inventory every tracker status, existing ownership, and initial `bv` triage.
- [x] Inspect source wiring, AST placeholder scan, release identity and receipts.
- [x] Execute actual released software in a fresh private remote workflow.
- [x] Investigate the failed phase and preserve its original terminal artifacts.
- [x] Produce 25-goal coverage matrix and concrete prioritized bridge.
- [x] Phase 3a: revise existing Beads with current evidence and acceptance.
- [x] Ambition round 1: improve repair delivery and contract-level integration.
- [x] Ambition round 2: improve fault/retry histories and resource bounds.
- [x] Ambition round 3: improve causal release gates and measurable claims.
- [x] Regenerate Beads from those improvements without duplicate tasks.
- [x] Refinement 1: stale scope, ownership and coverage.
- [x] Refinement 2: preserved behavior and realistic positive/negative tests.
- [x] Refinement 3: exact source, executed artifacts and evidence retention.
- [x] Refinement 4: dependencies and practical execution order.
- [x] Refinement 5: fresh convergence check, `br` cycles and `bv` triage.
- [x] Validate the document/tracker delta and report honest completion limits.

Process creation gate: this report is requested explicitly by the project owner
to decide the next implementation priorities. It catches the observed stale
assessment, red release gate and failed concurrent workflow. It earns zero
capability credit and is retired as active guidance when the next assessment
supersedes it; historical material is retained, not deleted. The highest-value
implementation remains the already-tested archive/runtime repairs, and this
assessment must hand back to that work after its requested phases.

### Ambition round 1 — complete the operator journey

The initial list fixes individual failures, but the user needs one coherent
mailbox through normal operation, trouble and recovery. Extend the existing
mixed workflow to cover **the same message identities and recipient state**
through live operation, verified archive fallback, supervised recovery and resumed
live operation. Check that a healthy primary still supplies fresh reads and that
archive-only browsing remains available when database opening fails. A successful
recovery must make new messages usable, not merely return a safe refusal.

This also improves delivery order: use separate, reviewable patches for archive
dispatch, polling, environment ownership and CORS, then run their combined real
workflow. Passing each isolated candidate is insufficient if the combined source
changes routing or cancellation. The later peer recovery/contact/guard changes
must be included in that integration candidate. Keep the safety negatives and
original feature behavior; do not turn the sequence into destructive production
recovery or add a second recovery runner.

### Ambition round 2 — separate safe retry from hidden overload

For the observed Busy response, an operation history must distinguish requested,
admitted, committed, replied and retried operations. Record first-attempt success,
eventual success, deadline failures and attempts per completed operation. A
healthy eventual result with rapidly growing attempts or queue/resource usage
still fails the declared operational budget. Retry only explicit retryable
responses within one original deadline; do not restart the clock per attempt.
Timeouts with unknown commit outcome require reconciliation before repeating a
mutation. This extends the existing bounded history checker rather than adding
another event schema or production telemetry service.

The cancellation boundary also includes retained pipes and output memory. The
tmux fixture needs a finite output control, an output-flood overflow case, an
inherited-pipe case and repeated probes. Cap accepted bytes before allocating
without limit, and prove the mechanism releases owned readers and children.
An error response at two seconds is not proof that resources were reclaimed.
Use independent bounds for caller latency, output bytes and cleanup grace.

### Ambition round 3 — make release acceptance follow the actual executable

The candidate-bound scorecard is valuable only if the manual publisher consumes
it. Define one immutable candidate input to the existing release entrypoint:
source and dirty-overlay identity, dependency closure, features, targets and
artifact digests. Required suites and installed parity must resolve to that same
candidate. Validate again immediately before the publish transition so a changed
artifact or substituted successful report cannot inherit an earlier approval.
Exercise the local transition with a valid positive and one altered term at a
time; no external test release is necessary.

Keep two conclusions explicit: distribution successfully published, and strict
acceptance satisfied. v0.3.34 meets the first within its documented scope; its
retained 12-failure workspace result prevents the second. An optional, unselected
hybrid/model lane cannot block a lexical-only candidate, but failed required
correctness cannot be relabeled optional after observing its result. The existing
release gate and its tests should enforce this; no second ledger or dashboard.

Bead regeneration adds these improvements to the existing implementation/test
pairs and publication owners. There are zero new issues: the contribution is
current, executable acceptance and a shorter route to delivery, not a larger queue.

### Five fresh refinement passes

1. **Scope and ownership:** checked all 25 rows against the complete issue
   inventory and current source. Updated obsolete manual-release/container task
   titles and attached the delivered GHCR evidence without claiming an unrun
   public pull. Kept every status/assignee intact. Candidate scorecard code is
   already present; its consumer/evidence is the remaining work. Gate development
   must not wait for every product repair; publication does. Shared runner file
   edits require one reservation owner at a time.
2. **Behavior and tests:** extended the existing history and performance
   companion tasks with legal Busy/retry/stable-identity and illegal duplicate
   histories, nonretryable auth/argument errors, deadline exhaustion, preserved
   read/ack state and completion-versus-amplification controls. Real process/DB
   observations remain decisive; synthetic counterexamples test the checker,
   not the product. No existing assertions, fixtures or functionality removed.
3. **Evidence identity:** verified the retained full-nextest log against its
   recorded SHA-256 and the fresh workflow/common-harness hashes against the
   release manifest. Separated released `0125f050`, full-test `43459c5a` and
   peer source `4717f869` (metadata HEAD `bd21aeb6`). The required installed
   parity/reliability packet remains missing from the retained release evidence;
   signatures and smoke do not substitute. Both successful and failed workflow
   invocations remain visible, without a new-engine regression claim.
4. **Dependencies and completion:** checked the real `.1/.3 -> .9 -> .10 -> .2`
   prerequisite chain and the independent budget/optional-quality pairs. Kept
   those edges; added no parent/child cycles or blanket product-bug dependency
   that would prevent authoring the publication gate. Found a genuine acceptance
   hole in `br-l1q6z`: its checklist required a recorded run but not restoration
   to zero unresolved required failures. Added that criterion explicitly so a
   well-documented red run cannot close the restoration task. Existing skips and
   leaky results must remain disclosed. `br ready` exposes the unowned budget
   lane, manual acceptance and tmux task; the tested repair lanes retain owners.
5. **Convergence:** rereviewed all 25 vision rows, the revised acceptance,
   implementation/test pairings, preserved defaults and source/evidence
   boundaries. No further scope or dependency changes were needed. Fresh `br`
   inventory has the same 2,457 IDs, zero additions/removals, and zero status or
   assignee changes. All literal Bead IDs in this assessment resolve. Final
   `bv --robot-triage` completed; `br dep cycles --json` reports zero active
   cycles. `git diff --check` passes. Scoped UBS exits 3 because Markdown is
   unsupported: it ran no scanner and is not reported as a pass.

### Honesty and work audit

Window: this September 8 reality-check request, with the prior release packet
reviewed specifically for claims being relied on. The product's purpose is
persistent, auditable coordination between coding agents. Output classification:
one updated assessment and the existing Bead revisions are **PROCESS**; no USER
or ENABLER implementation is claimed. The fresh actual-binary run provides
evidence, not a new feature. This is bounded work requested by the operator;
its next consumer is the implementation owner choosing the repair sequence.

Creation worksheet: running code does not branch on this report. The explicit
operator request supplies its consumer and decision gate; observed defects are
the stale assessment, failed concurrent workflow and unmet release acceptance.
It retires as active guidance at the next assessment. The integrity-control
exception is unnecessary: the explicit request already qualifies it. Its minimal
form is this existing document and existing tracker, not another report system.
An hour on the existing archive/polling repairs would yield more runtime benefit;
the assessment therefore stops here and hands off to them.

Real-work worksheet: no feature shipped in this audit to demonstrate; the earlier
release and new peer fixes are not credited to it. Without the process work, the
same binaries would exist, but the user would lack this requested correction and
prioritized plan. No speculative runtime enabler was created. Long-standing
durability/corruption work (`br-htobc` among the oldest actionable rows) remains
valuable; this window addressed the explicitly requested steering instead.
No new swarm was dispatched, no closure count is used as progress, and no task
was split to close an unmet parent. Disposition: legitimate requested assessment,
zero capability credit; another planning round would be drift.

Honesty inventory, numbered against the skill worksheet:

1. No test weakened/deleted/ignored (checked: this turn's diff contains only this
   document and Beads; the restoration criterion was strengthened).
2. No test double introduced (checked: no test/source edits).
3. No golden regenerated (checked: no test/fixture edits by this audit; peer
   contact fixture changes are separately identified, not certified here).
4. No validator/CI relaxation (checked: no runtime gate edits; any `[skip ci]`
   commit annotation follows the user's explicit no-Actions instruction).
5. No fabricated gate satisfaction (checked: red full suite and failed workflow
   are retained and prevent a strict-ready claim).
6. No zero-run green (checked: 41/1 fresh assertions; AST zero matches is only a
   scan result; UBS exit 3 is explicitly no scan).
7. No unrun-command claim (checked: full suite is retained evidence at its named
   source, not a fresh run of the later main; missing parity is disclosed).
8. No fixture upgraded to live proof (checked: actual release binaries and real
   transport/storage for the fresh run; model/encoder substitutes stay limited).
9. **Correction required for prior release wording:** publication completion must
   not mean every release gate passed. The retained 12-failure suite and absent
   mandatory parity/scorecard packet leave strict acceptance unfinished. This
   correction is explicit here and on `br-nq2kb`/`br-bx73n`; failed required
   tests cannot be made optional after the result is known.
10. No cited command hides stderr (checked: failed client stderr and suite output
    retained; unsupported UBS and initial inventory-parser errors disclosed).
11. No unmet item closed (checked: all initial statuses and assignees preserved).
12. No requirement rewritten to match success (checked: zero-failure gate retained;
    concurrent Busy retry remains an explicit acceptance decision with negatives).
13–17. No new delegated agents or accepted subagent assertions in this window;
    peer commits are source observations, not independently verified tests or
    agreement-based proof. No refusal farming or delegated closures are credited.
18. Denominators are the complete retained run and the complete fresh workflow;
    no passing subset substitutes for either.
19. The moments requiring explanation are the initial inventory parser expecting
    an array instead of the returned object, one optional-field parser correction,
    the failed workflow and the release-completion distinction. Parser errors
    were corrected before deriving inventory claims; product failures stay red.
20. Strongest evidence: re-executable release workflow with exact binary/harness
    hashes, 41 passing assertions, original failed client stderr and joined process
    outcomes. Source/Bead validation is a separate, reproducible document check.

No additional CASS-wide older-session honesty sweep is claimed; this window uses
the retained release receipts and current source directly. The prior-release
wording correction is recorded in place, disclosed to the operator, and guarded
by explicit zero-failure acceptance on `br-l1q6z` and the manual publisher task
(`RH-9` follow-up laundering / `RH-10` plan edits cannot stand in for delivery).
Review is solo and bounded, not independent verification of new peer code.

**Handoff:** all requested skill phases are complete. The project remains
unfinished for the reasons above; implementation Beads remain open. Resume the
existing repair-delivery lane, then complete actual concurrent/recovery workflow
acceptance and the manual release gate. Do not create another planning campaign.

## Historical September 4 assessment (superseded)

<details>
<summary>September 4 assessment and earlier retained proposal; use September 8 guidance above</summary>

**Current assessment:** 2026-09-04, GentleBeaver, requested full `reality-check-for-project` workflow.
**Source reviewed:** `a6ebaf5057ad40f5de16b3c44b35e8472bf5c699` on `main`; earlier observations began at `ff47e953`. The checkout changed during the audit, so observations identify their actual revision or binary.
**Installed executable:** `am 0.3.32`, SHA-256 `8eea1560ece6d30912af107d2de5f4f66e9a8b4ece2d447ea239c0f6b23975d3`. This is not evidence that the installed executable contains current `main`.

This September 4 assessment supersedes every recommendation in the collapsed September 2 proposal below. That proposal is retained as historical evidence, not as instructions to perform repairs, delete artifacts, change defaults, or reopen completed work. No production code, shared mailbox repair, release publication, or engine migration is part of this assessment.

## Assessment and evidence boundaries

**Agent Mail has a substantial real implementation, but current evidence does not establish a finished, reliably releasable product.** Messaging, persistence, recovery, search, CLI, TUI, web, guard, share, and ATC contain real code and extensive tests. The strongest concerns are the failed basic installed-binary send, a live unhealthy integrity verdict, unresolved engine/visibility cases, unavailable current full-suite verification, and release evidence that is not sufficiently tied to a particular candidate. A count of closed Beads is not a completion percentage.

The audit read all of `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`, the root and `docs/planning` vision/transition/architecture plans (including full Python-behavior extraction), accepted and superseded ADRs, current SPEC/design documents, release/rollout plans, ATC/search/TUI contracts, and verification/performance ledgers. Identical duplicates were verified by content hashes; divergent copies were read through their differences. Historical results remain historical. Keyword, Rust AST, and behavioral inspection were combined: the `todo!`/`unimplemented!` AST scans found no hits in `crates`, while inspected stub encoders and LLM fixtures are explicit test substitutes. This does not prove every implementation correct.

| Evidence | Actual result | What it establishes |
|---|---|---|
| Isolated installed-binary stdio workflow | Initialize, list 45 tools, list resource templates, create project, and register BlueLake/GreenStone passed. First `send_message` returned JSON-RPC `-32004`, `Request timeout exceeded`, after 30,003 ms. Server exited 0 after stdin closed. | Basic workflow failed in this environment. Inbox/ack/search/reservation/build-slot/broadcast cases after send were **not reached**. No causal diagnosis of the timeout or claim of current-main regression. |
| Live MCP `health_check` | Red integrity verdict: a prior failed full check remains authoritative despite a later passing quick check. Other reported sections green; archive/DB message totals both 40,479 at observation. | A quick check must not erase known full-check failure. Equal aggregate counts do not prove row-level parity or healthy storage. No repair was attempted. |
| Live session coordination | `macro_start_session` timed out at 30 s in unattributed blocking dispatch, but GentleBeaver registration persisted. Granular reservation of this plan succeeded; inbox was empty. | A timed-out composite request can have partial effects. Repeating the whole macro without checking state is unsafe as a correctness assumption. Stage was not attributed to SQLite or archive. |
| Standalone `am doctor health` | Exit 1 with `local_config_unattested`; private probe reported six reservation-field differences. | Not an attested probe of the same live target. Do not conflate this result with the live MCP integrity verdict. Private probe artifacts were retained. |
| Current-source remote nextest, source receipt | Rejected non-regular `.doctor/latest` symlink during transfer. | `NO_VERDICT`: zero tests ran. Do not remove the symlink to satisfy transfer. |
| Current-source remote nextest, clean overlay at `a6ebaf50` | Cargo manifest loading failed: gated sibling `../frankensearch-rel-0332/frankensearch/Cargo.toml` missing on worker. | `NO_VERDICT`: no compilation or tests. Existing `br-rch-frankensearch-closure-jdgvg` owns dependency closure. No local build fallback used. |
| Latest full-suite result recorded in Beads | `br-l1q6z`, comment 2677: gate 8 at `a04a5807`, September 3, 17,270 run, 16 failed, 37 skipped. Later comments report focused fixes. | Historical recorded result, not independently replayed here. Neither the old ~212 nor projected 14 is a current measured failure count. |
| Public release and automation, live GitHub API | Latest release v0.3.32, September 1, six target families. Core CI/dist/docker/publish workflows disabled manually. Issue-138 one-shot succeeded September 4; latest coordinated release-risk runs failed. | Release assets exist; this audit did not install/verify each asset. A specialized green job is not a full release gate. |

Local evidence retained: `/tmp/am-reality-runtime-v2-20260904.log`, `/data/tmp/am-reality-20260904-ldf22flm/{summary.json,transcript.jsonl,server.stderr}`, `/tmp/am-reality-nextest-20260904.log`, `/tmp/am-reality-nextest-clean-20260904.log`, `/tmp/am-reality-health-20260904.log`, and `/tmp/am-reality-beads-initial-20260904.json`. The first probe's missing `notifications/initialized` was corrected in the harness; that protocol error is excluded from product findings. These host-local paths are audit breadcrumbs, not durable release receipts.

## Vision checklist and coverage

`WORKING (bounded)` below applies only to the behavior actually exercised. `PARTIAL` means implementation exists with known missing or failing integration; `UNPROVEN` means this audit could not establish the promised behavior. Source presence and historical tests are explicitly distinguished. No whole-product percentage is assigned.

| # | Testable promise and authority | Current status and implementation evidence | Remaining coverage / disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 45 discoverable tools; README tools/AGENTS registry | WORKING (bounded): installed `tools/list` returned 45; real handlers in `tools/src` | Per-tool behavior remains part of `br-l1q6z` and conformance, not proven by listing. |
| 2 | 25 logical resource contracts; README/AGENTS | PARTIAL: `tools/src/resources.rs`; recent-ring/filter implementation now real (`br-ciwph` closed) | Preserve 25 logical templates versus raw handler count; `br-4meup`, current conformance gate. Do not recreate the fixed empty-resource defect. |
| 3 | Explicit recipients, replies, topics, read/ack, retry; README | PARTIAL: `messaging.rs`, `queries.rs` transactional inserts and idempotency; installed send timed out | `br-sa58k`, `br-oeam8`, `br-e0blb`, `br-l1q6z`; new mixed-workflow acceptance. |
| 4 | Never broadcast; AGENTS Rule 2 | UNPROVEN in fresh execution, implemented refusal at tool boundary | Keep rejection and its tests; include negative control in mixed workflow. No feature request to enable it. |
| 5 | Git archive plus authoritative SQLite index; README durability contract | PARTIAL: transactional DB first, deferred archive/backlog in `messaging.rs` and `storage/src/lib.rs` | Require bounded eventual mirror convergence, not archive-before-ack; `br-0flbu`, `br-htobc`, new workflow/history coverage. |
| 6 | Correct swarm concurrency and deadlines; README gauntlet | PARTIAL: real stress suites, but failed installed send and live macro | `br-9bwnb`, `br-eru3j`, `br-22gm3`, `br-qz7rz`, `br-fkam4`, new sustained process workload. Old gauntlet is a dated run, not zero-failure warranty. |
| 7 | Safe recovery, no source loss or false health; mailbox SPEC/AGENTS | PARTIAL: guarded family/recovery receipt and quarantine machinery; live integrity red | `br-qdgio`, `br-r6psd`, `br-sd3md`, `br-zchj0`, `br-oyget`, `br-jcgxg`, `br-y1elw`; existing chaos suite retained. |
| 8 | Runtime engine policy and cancel-aware async; AGENTS | Implemented policy, end-to-end UNPROVEN: FrankenSQLite 0.3.16 runtime; canonical C SQLite verifier/recovery exception; asupersync | No new engine ADR required. Keep `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` default; upstream/visibility cases and `br-of0ra` remain. Never infer permission to enable concurrent mode. |
| 9 | Reservation leases, contact policy, identity lifecycle; README | PARTIAL: real typed DB paths and lease artifacts; isolated registration and live plan lease passed | `br-ssog9`, `br-g6c0z`, `br-qayvs`, lifecycle/import tasks; prove renew/release/retirement across restart. |
| 10 | Build slots and cross-project product bus; README | UNPROVEN current run: real `build_slots.rs`, products handlers | Advisory slot conflicts are not mutex exclusion. Mixed tests must preserve product membership and contact constraints. |
| 11 | 16-screen operational TUI; README/TUI V2 contract | UNPROVEN current rendering: real screens and snapshots, historical coverage | `br-boq46`, `br-y8k4z`, `br-mljnz`; require actual render/interaction receipts, not catalog counts. |
| 12 | Web/mail routes and scoped archive browsing; README/web SPEC | UNPROVEN current HTTP run: real `server/src/mail_ui.rs` routes reuse bounded pool/Cx | Existing HTTP/security suites in current gate; browser-wide parity proposal is deferred, not an unfinished shipped promise. |
| 13 | 19 robot commands and usable noninteractive CLI; README | PARTIAL: real `cli/src/robot.rs` and command dispatch; historical speedups | `br-eru3j`, `br-49eak`, `br-22gm3`, `br-4myjj`, `br-4meup`; native benchmark coverage. |
| 14 | Reversible, scoped doctor operations; AGENTS/doctor SPEC | PARTIAL: `doctor/mutate.rs` seven Op variants, backups/witnesses/undo and owner guard | `br-qdgio`, `br-r6psd`, `br-x2jf5`, `br-l4fk6`; same-target health attestation required. Never repair the shared mailbox as an audit side effect. |
| 15 | Bare `am`, setup, auth and configuration authority; README | PARTIAL: real dispatch/setup; substantial unfinished OAuth/config/credential tasks | `br-siq0z`, `br-ww5js`, `br-q8k82`, `br-vzh8o`, `br-x5a8y`, `br-fphbm`, `br-17tyc`. |
| 16 | Lexical release search; optional source hybrid; README Search V3 | PARTIAL: `search.rs` and `search_service.rs` real routes/fallback diagnostics | `br-7x5fm`, `br-ku0kl`, `br-eh8bj`; real quality suite exists, fresh feature-specific result absent. Do not promise hybrid in portable release artifacts. |
| 17 | Useful optional LLM summaries and TOON; plans/README realism policy | UNPROVEN decisive dependencies: `test_llm.sh` sets LLM stub; `test_toon.sh` simulates encoder output | NO_BEAD for fresh real-provider/real-encoder compensation found among unfinished tasks; new optional-quality lane. Offline substitutes remain useful R2/R3 evidence. |
| 18 | ATC learning, quiet defaults and safe effects; ATC SPEC | PARTIAL: real policy algorithms, experience seam and historical real canary; not fleet-duration proof | `br-hwney`, `br-au76r`; add restart/quiet/scoped-effect scenarios to sustained workflow. Keep default shadow/write-off. |
| 19 | Signed/private share exports, guard enforcement; README/threat SPEC | UNPROVEN current run: real scrub/crypto/snapshot/guard code and existing real tests | `br-ji2f0`, `br-vzh8o`, `br-x5a8y`, current security/share/guard gate; hash and authorization negative controls. |
| 20 | Verified installer/update, native targets, container/crate delivery; README/release plans | PARTIAL: six release families and real verifier; current venue/artifact tests incomplete | `br-nq2kb`, `br-8tszv`, `br-54v1u`, `br-1csqy`, `br-quq4r`, `br-bx73n`, `br-ocys6`, `br-95spu`, `br-7ilwx`, `br-s1ejh`, `br-p9zor`. |
| 21 | Lossless legacy import and explicit old-repo transition; transition plan | PARTIAL: real import/recovery; external cutover decision not inferred | `br-dbt24`, `br-lkhxw`, `br-8echk`, `br-mrfhc`, `br-p4s42`, `br-ajiq8`. No deletion or forced cutover. |
| 22 | Current complete checks and reliable test orchestration; AGENTS | UNPROVEN at audited HEAD; historical full gate red and remote attempts blocked | `br-l1q6z`, `br-rch-frankensearch-closure-jdgvg`, `br-sox5q`, `br-e38t0`; fresh source/ELF/terminal evidence required. |
| 23 | Honored latency/resource budgets; README/benches | UNPROVEN current performance: native benches and historical baselines exist | NO_BEAD found for current route-specific baseline admission/calibration; new operational-budget lane. No latency extrapolation from registry calls. |
| 24 | Trustworthy docs and Beads; README/AGENTS | PARTIAL: widespread useful docs, but historical topology and former plan advice stale | `br-4meup`, `br-l1z6f`, `br-cdwya`, `br-of0ra`; this report corrects the plan now. |
| 25 | Public dashboard replay and explicit browser limits; current AGENTS | UNPROVEN deployed bundle here: standalone dashboard exists; live browser mirror deferred | Preserve `br-f9avw`/`br-f9avw.10`, `br-mq9q1`; do not exclude this current surface as the September 2 proposal did. |

Initial Beads snapshot: 2,430 issues, 2,276 closed, 86 open, 68 in progress. `bv` found no cycles; 148 actionable and six dependency-blocked unfinished items. Its response nests `quick_ref` under `triage`; a null from the wrong jq path does not show graph corruption. Forecast 53.11 days at confidence 0.4029 is not an engineering ETA. Existing claims/assignees stay intact.

## Bridge: concrete gaps and implementation sequence

All new work extends existing modules/runners. No second issue tracker, evidence dashboard, schema registry, async runtime, or replacement test framework is proposed. Each implementation task has a companion test task with real-path coverage and terminal artifacts. Existing issue scopes are retained and receive current observations rather than duplicate ownership.

| Gap | Severity / kind | Change, acceptance and starting surface | Size / dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1: basic send and partial composite timeout | P0 integration investigation | Attach exact installed-binary transcript to `br-l1q6z`; compare the same scenario on a worker-built current candidate. Attribute elapsed stages and reconcile durable outcome before retry. `br-9bwnb` receives live macro context without claiming common cause. | S reproduction; fixes through existing owners; current RCH closure first for source validation. |
| G2: current durability/recovery truth | P0 correctness | Complete existing message ID, family-generation, WAL/oracle and recovery tasks above. Add bounded mixed-process stdio/HTTP workflow to `e2e_runner.rs`, `load_bench.rs` and existing soak suites; reuse incident corpus. Preserve DB-first acknowledgement and eventual archive semantics. | L runner + M companion tests; start independently, certify after causal fixes. |
| G3: candidate-bound release evidence | P0 proof/integration | `newest_incident_scorecard` currently selects global newest mtime with five-second slack. Bind incident, suite, executable, source, lock/dependency closure, features, target and run ID; reject mismatches or incomplete required suites. Extend `write_release_scorecard` and existing producers. | M implementation + M negative/e2e tests; feed `br-nq2kb` and `br-bx73n`, do not replace their publication/venue work. |
| G4: honest current workspace verification | P0 proof | Refresh `br-l1q6z` from last terminal run, keep ignored/flaky cases classified, repair RCH sibling transfer with owner. Run required check/clippy/fmt and process-isolated nextest, then real required E2E suites. A worker/setup refusal is not a pass. | Existing tasks; no new blanket "fix all tests" epic. |
| G5: operational budgets with route truth | P1 performance/proof | Extend `cli/src/bench.rs` and `benches/BUDGETS.md` with separate cold/warm, actual SQL/Tantivy/hybrid route, queue/acquire/write/archive spans, memory/FD/disk, per-host baseline identities and bounded load admission. Run controls before accepting relative effects. | M implementation + M companion control tests; current candidate and quiet measured host. |
| G6: real optional dependency quality | P1 proof | Extend existing search-quality, LLM and TOON suites with selected real dependencies, explicit effective mode, bounded corpus/model/tokenizer IDs, scoped results and compensated offline lanes. Missing dependency is `NO_VERDICT` for that feature, never synthetic quality success. | M implementation + M companion tests; no paid provider calls or feature-default changes in this audit. |
| G7: ATC restart, quiet and feedback behavior | P1 integration/proof | Extend mixed workflow with shadow/write-off zero-effect invariants, controlled restart/hydration and explicit isolated effect-enabled scenarios. Compare policy decisions with recorded outcomes, noise and recovery, not merely experience-row count. | M scenario extension; depends on existing `br-hwney`/`br-au76r` for certification, not for writing failing tests. |
| G8: existing delivery/security/import/UI/docs gaps | P0–P2 existing implementation | Execute mapped owner tasks; publish only tested target/feature claims. Add current acceptance to `br-4meup` for verifier exception, lexical artifacts, deferred browser scope, dated ledgers and safe commands. Preserve existing substantive tests and manual decision tasks. | Existing backlog; independent lanes, no automatic bulk reassignment/closure. |

Proposed fleet acceptance is **a new validation target**, not a retroactive README guarantee: 24 hours on each of two explicitly identified hosts, at least 13 projects, 90 actual client processes and 300 messages/hour, with mixed leases/reads/acks/replies/products and controlled restarts. A bounded smoke is required first; run duration/rate/process census and all interruptions are recorded. Success requires no lost acknowledged message, no duplicate committed idempotent send, no cross-scope exposure, no corruption, no stranded owned child, and drained archive/DB reconciliation. Numerical performance thresholds must be measured and justified per route; no blanket p99 < 2 s assertion or automatic budget inflation.

Release acceptance order: establish exact candidate/dependency closure → obtain current correctness results → bounded real workflow and fault tests → sustained/performance/optional-quality evidence → candidate-bound scorecard → existing publication gate. Harness development, UI/docs fixes and optional test design can proceed in parallel; final certification alone waits on upstream fixes. Do not block every task on an epic or on an unresolved engine-policy decision already settled by AGENTS.

## Workflow execution log

Phase 1 and Phase 2 completed in this revision. Phase 3a begins from the gaps above; the remaining entries are updated as the rounds actually run. The frozen instruction used for bead generation is retained verbatim:

```text
OK so please take ALL of that and elaborate on it and use it to create a comprehensive and granular
set of beads for all this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid, with detailed
comments so that the whole thing is totally self-contained and self-documenting (including relevant
background, reasoning/justification, considerations, etc.-- anything we'd want our "future self" to
know about the goals and intentions and thought process and how it serves the over-arching goals of
the project.) The beads should be so detailed that we never need to consult back to the original
markdown plan document. Remember to ONLY use the `br` tool to create and modify the beads and add
the dependencies.
```

Phase 3a baseline created with `br` only: epic `br-kp1in`; workflow implementation/tests `.1`/`.2`; candidate evidence implementation/tests `.3`/`.4`; operational budgets implementation/tests `.5`/`.6`; optional quality implementation/tests `.7`/`.8`. Existing `br-l1q6z`, `br-9bwnb`, `br-rch-frankensearch-closure-jdgvg`, `br-bx73n`, `br-nq2kb` and `br-4meup` received current evidence without reassignment or closure. The original ~212 failure count remains historical evidence; the title and body now ask for a fresh complete result. Baseline graph cycle check passed.

### Ambition round 1: make completion decidable for each shipped capability

The baseline is useful, but a single green aggregate could still hide an untested feature or demand optional dependencies from every release. The revised plan makes the unit of acceptance `(candidate, target, feature selection, capability, decisive path)` rather than a repository-wide boolean. Required capabilities must each have a nonempty required suite/case set and real-path receipt; optional unselected capabilities are explicitly outside that candidate's claim. A selected but unavailable capability is `NO_VERDICT`, not success. Historical certificates remain readable but do not satisfy a changed candidate.

The scorecard producer must capture the executable it actually launches, rather than resolve `am` again from PATH at report time. It must carry the gated sibling revision and effective route, not only a top-level commit. Artifacts are passed through the existing runner's owned invocation directory and exact child receipt; no `latest` directory or mtime heuristic supplies causal identity. Mutation-sensitive negative controls must show that changing one identity or removing one required case changes acceptance.

Risk order is explicit: source-closure and evidence binding can proceed while product owners fix deadlines and recovery. Current source correctness precedes speed certification. Optional quality work is independently claimable, and release readiness for a lexical-only candidate never silently expands to hybrid or provider-backed summaries. This round improves `.3`/`.4` and `.7`/`.8`; regeneration occurs after all ambition rounds.

### Ambition round 2: exercise failure boundaries without inventing guarantees

The process workload must describe its topology: many real HTTP clients against the supervised mailbox owner, separately bounded stdio sessions, and explicitly admitted standalone process races. Ninety clients do not mean ninety forbidden simultaneous owner daemons. Existing `db/tests/load_bench.rs` already runs full integrity and exact message/recipient counts before and after reopen; retain that coverage and add user-visible histories and archive convergence rather than rebuilding it.

Failure cases are divided by operation boundary: before admission, before commit, after commit but before response, during archive drain, during owner restart, and during recovery-generation promotion. Requests with lost replies remain indeterminate until durable reconciliation. Idempotency guarantees apply only within the configured retention window and key scope. ID gaps are legal; uniqueness and durable election are the properties to check. Broadcast refusal, contact checks, bcc privacy, advisory reservations/build slots, and product membership are preserved rather than replaced with a generic queue model.

Admission and backpressure need their own observable cases: slow reader, stalled archive worker, saturated pool, canceled waiter, and recovery refusal. Every selected fault targets an owned fixture, has a bounded duration and cancellation path, and records remaining work at the deadline. Default read paths are tested for no unintended writes. ATC noise is reported against actual decision opportunities and labels; zero observed alerts is a sample, not proof of zero false-positive probability. Hosts and measurement windows remain separate.

This round also requires an immutable input manifest for corpus/budgets and exact artifact locations; the existing soak trend code's global newest-file searches cannot supply acceptance evidence. The current source has useful before/after integrity checks already, so no new bead asks to add those from scratch.

### Ambition round 3: bounded history checking and defensible measurement

The most useful mathematical addition is a small specification of observable state transitions and a bounded partial-order history checker. For the transactional mailbox core, search for a legal sequential history consistent with each client's request/response order, durable commit witnesses and explicitly synchronized barriers. Do not invent a total order from wall clocks on different hosts. A timeout can be completed or omitted according to later durable evidence; it cannot automatically count as a failed write. The checker must report `PASS`, a minimal counterexample, or `NO_VERDICT` when evidence or exploration bounds are insufficient.

Use different properties for different consistency contracts: linearizable idempotent insert/recipient transactions; causal read/ack constraints; generation-aware recovery; eventual archive convergence only after bounded drain; reservation/build-slot behavior as actually promised; and per-scope authorization for search/products. Partition independent project/key histories only when shared global ID/generation constraints remain checked. This is a focused extension of the existing test helpers, not a model checker for all 45 tools or an alternate implementation of the server.

Add a companion test task with hand-auditable legal and illegal histories: duplicate commit after retry, acknowledged row missing after restart, ID reuse across processes, stale-generation lease resurrection, unauthorized result, allowed transient archive lag, truncated trace, and exploration exhaustion. At least one trace comes from real transport and recovery rather than fabricated events. Negative fixtures prove the checker rejects known bad behavior; property tests alone cannot establish a real runtime path.

For performance, separate the operational SLO predicate from the comparative estimator. Use paired samples and a predeclared A/A tolerance; retain sample counts, uncertainty and independent windows. A failed null or contaminated window invalidates a relative claim without erasing an absolute latency failure. For ATC, report false effects/decision opportunities and label availability; confidence bounds require their independence assumptions to be stated. These techniques make failures interpretable rather than decorate the plan with unused mathematics.

Phase 3a regeneration completed with `br`: added `.9` history checker and `.10` companion tests under `br-kp1in`, and appended each applicable ambition improvement to the original eight children. No implementation was started as a shortcut around refinement.

### Phase 5: five plan-space refinement passes

`AGENTS.md` was reread in full before this phase. The frozen instruction applied to each pass is:

```text
Reread AGENTS.md so it's still fresh in your mind.
Check over each bead super carefully-- are you sure it makes sense? Is it optimal? Could we change
anything to make the system work better for users? If so, revise the beads. It's a lot easier and
faster to operate in "plan space" before we start implementing these things! DO NOT OVERSIMPLIFY
THINGS! DO NOT LOSE ANY FEATURES OR FUNCTIONALITY! Also make sure that as part of the beads we
include comprehensive unit tests and e2e test scripts with great, detailed logging so we can be
sure that everything is working perfectly after implementation. Make sure to ONLY use the `br` cli
tool for all changes, and you can and should also use the `bv` tool to help diagnose potential
problems with the beads.
```

Pass outcomes are recorded below as completed, with actual changes and checks.

1. **Ownership, scope and dependencies:** checked every new bead against existing tasks and AGENTS. Added `.9 → .3` for the candidate record contract and `.2 → .10` for validated history checking before final workflow certification. No cycle; `.1`, `.3`, `.5` and `.7` remain implementation entry points. Optional quality does not block lexical-only certification.
2. **Feature preservation and test realism:** added cursor expiry/ahead versus message-ID cases, configurable read receipts, macro partial effects, candidate-specific retry support, per-case substitute compensation, offered/completed-rate accounting to prevent coordinated omission, and distinct native/external TOON routes. Every implementation has a companion test bead; real transport/persistence remains decisive.
3. **Artifact integrity and observer failure:** added unique invocation directories, atomic report publication, digest/path/symlink checks, bounded recorder queues/disk, incomplete-trace refusal, privacy canaries, provider budget/cancellation controls, and clock-ordering limits. Tests challenge artifact failures as well as product failures; the observer cannot discard bad samples and report success.
4. **Execution and authority:** checked all 25 vision rows and all referenced Bead IDs; refreshed the misleading historical headlines of `br-l1q6z` and `br-bx73n` without discarding their evidence. Added an explicit field-contract handoff for the two runner-editing tasks, frozen premeasurement budgets and capability-specific closure. `br ready` exposes `.1`, `.3`, `.5`, `.7`; the epic shown by `bv` is coordination, not a fifth code lane. `git diff --check` passed. Scoped UBS returned exit 3 because Markdown/JSONL are unsupported; no scanner ran, so this is not claimed as a code scan pass.
5. **Convergence:** rereviewed all 11 new issues, five implementation/test pairs, eight blocking edges, 25 vision rows and existing-task mappings. No further scope, acceptance, ownership or dependency changes were needed. `br dep cycles --json` returned zero cycles. `bv --robot-insights` skipped cycle analysis above 2,000 nodes, so its absent cycle output is not a proof; `br` supplied the explicit check. The JSONL delta contains exactly 11 added and six updated issues, zero removed, with all existing assignees/statuses preserved.

### Final handoff

All applicable skill phases are complete: assessment, bridge plan, initial Beads, three ambition rounds, Bead regeneration and five refinement passes ending without another plan change. Implementation remains open under `br-kp1in`; this audit does not close reliability, release or quality claims.

| Lane | Implementation | Companion tests | Ready implementation? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mixed process workflows and ATC | `br-kp1in.1` | `br-kp1in.2` | Yes; agree on runner field contract with `.3` |
| Candidate/run-bound scorecards | `br-kp1in.3` | `br-kp1in.4` | Yes; first P0 recommendation |
| Operational routes and budgets | `br-kp1in.5` | `br-kp1in.6` | Yes |
| Real optional dependency quality | `br-kp1in.7` | `br-kp1in.8` | Yes for implementation; real acceptance requires selected dependencies |
| Bounded history consistency | `br-kp1in.9` | `br-kp1in.10` | Waits on `.1` and `.3` |

Final observed inventory: 2,441 issues = 2,276 closed + 97 open + 68 in progress. `br ready` confirms four new code-bearing entry points; no existing task was claimed, reopened or closed. Recheck source, readiness and reservations when starting implementation because this is a shared active checkout.

Validation of this deliverable covers Markdown structure, 25-row coverage, live Bead IDs, JSONL preservation, exact dependency edges and `git diff --check`. No Rust source changed. Current-source execution remains `NO_VERDICT` for the two documented RCH prerequisites; the installed-binary failed workflow and historical full-suite result retain their narrower provenance. The shared mailbox and peer `lock-sync/` directory were preserved.

## 0. What moved since the reality check (2026-09-01 evening wave)

Commits `ba1b8a42`, `888aea20` (partly a parallel session's sweep of this working tree) and `f85b22c2` changed the status of several goals. The plan below is written against the state after those commits.

| Goal | Reality check | Now | What changed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 self-healing recovery | PARTIAL | PARTIAL (better) | breaker self-poisoning inside a process's own recovery admission fixed; false P0 on a healthy live mailbox fixed; read-only CLI processes no longer counted as owners; engine-dispatching read-only opener lets restored/reconstructed families be inventoried, backed up, salvaged and reconciled; promotion retires stale namespace records |
| 10 robot mode | PARTIAL | PARTIAL (better) | `am robot handoff` 600 s timeout → 0.30 s on the 40k-message mailbox, `--max-seconds` budget; `am robot metrics` reads live daemon counters |
| 11 doctor | PARTIAL | PARTIAL (better) | four disagreeing verdicts reduced: doctor health no longer P0 on a healthy file; doctor source selection by namespace authority; `doctor reconstruct` can salvage the current database |
| 15 description parity | NOT ENFORCED | ENFORCED (WORKING) | `tool_description_parity.rs` compares types through nullable arrays instead of passing on mismatch; 55-entry error catalog |
| 16 all tests green | REGRESSED | REGRESSED (smaller) | class A (27), C (23), D (20), E2 and most of E1 (28) retired; per-process `cargo nextest` is now the only trusted runner (the storage-root guard is nextest-safe again after a one-commit regression) |
| 21 docs are the truth | PARTIAL | PARTIAL (better) | README/AGENTS counts and flags corrected to the binary; `doc_consistency` pins doctor verbs, robot subcommands, themes; VISION carries dated reality notes |
| new finding | — | — | `file_reservation_paths` timed out twice at 30 s on the live daemon in the unattributed blocking-dispatch stage (`br-9bwnb`): direct evidence for the durability gap |

Still unmoved: goals 5 (swarm durability), 7 (engine strategy), 13 (search in shipped binaries), 14 (ATC default), 17 (delivery venues), 19, 20, 22, 23.

## 1. Critical gaps (the vision is undeliverable without these)

### Gap 1: Zero errors or corruption under swarm load (goal 5) — REGRESSED → WORKING

**Current state.** The README's "Rust vs Python gauntlet" section states the Python failure modes are gone. Field reports GH#257 (re-corruption 61 min after a clean integrity check at 316 msg/h), GH#278 (macOS snapshot conflicts then malformed pages) and `br-htobc` (index corruption under SIGKILL) say the failure modes moved from git index locks into the storage engine. The only test that could prove the claim, the 100-agent lifecycle test in `crates/mcp-agent-mail-storage/tests/stress_pipeline.rs`, is `#[ignore]`d for an engine correctness bug ("no such table: messages" across concurrent opens); `stress_150_agent_message_storm` (line 1935) is ignored for concurrent-open serialization (p99 ~50 s vs a 45 s guard, upstream `bd-xva84`). The pool p99 on the reference host reached 18.2 s acquire and 20 s write inside a 10-minute window, and on 2026-09-02 two `file_reservation_paths` calls timed out at 30 s in `blocking_dispatch_unattributed` while `release_file_reservations` returned instantly (`br-9bwnb`). `BEGIN CONCURRENT` exists but `Config::fsqlite_concurrent_mode` (config.rs:373) defaults to `false` because of an upstream snapshot-drift bug; 85 call sites use `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. The pragma conformance harness (`docs/FRANKENSQLITE_PRAGMA_GAPS.md`) records 35 divergences.

**Target state.** A cross-process swarm harness that runs at or above the GH#257 rate (≥ 300 msg/h across ≥ 13 projects and ≥ 90 agents, with reservation churn and restarts) for 24 h on two hosts, ends with `PRAGMA integrity_check = ok`, `quick_check = ok`, zero foreign-key violations, archive/DB parity, and no `pending_sends` residue, and does so on the pinned engine line. The README claim is either re-earned by that run or rewritten to what the run proves.

**Success criteria.**
- [ ] `am e2e run --project . --tag swarm` (new tag) drives ≥ 90 agent processes (not threads) through send/reply/ack/reserve/release/handoff for a configurable duration and emits a JSON scorecard with message rate, p50/p99 tool latency, integrity verdicts before/after a SIGKILL restart, and reservation grant latency.
- [ ] The scorecard shows 0 corruption events, 0 unattributed timeouts, reservation grant p99 < 2 s, at 300 msg/h for 24 h on ts1 and on one other host.
- [ ] `stress_150_agent_message_storm` and the 100-agent lifecycle test are un-ignored or replaced by the harness, with their upstream blockers cited on the replacement.
- [ ] `br-9bwnb` closed with the attributed stage and a regression test that drives `file_reservation_paths` under a held archive commit.

**Implementation plan.**
1. Attribute the reservation timeout first: instrument the blocking-dispatch lane (`crates/mcp-agent-mail-server` dispatch metrics, the `contended_path` / stage fields already exposed in timeout replies) so every timeout names its stage; reproduce with the live mailbox using the `am` binary against a copy; fix the grant path (conflict scan of `file_reservations/` artifacts, JSON artifact write, DB insert) so it is bounded.
2. Build the harness as a native e2e suite (`am e2e` already discovers 153 suites at runtime; add `swarm_soak` with `--agents`, `--projects`, `--rate`, `--duration`, `--restart-every`): spawn real `am` processes over stdio, drive the MCP tools, sample `health_check` and `resource://tooling/metrics`, run the doctor's double probe at the end.
3. Run it on both engine lines the repo can pin (`fsqlite =0.3.14` now; the next upstream release when available) and record the results under `tests/artifacts/swarm_soak/<ts>/`.
4. Feed every corruption reproduction into the frankensqlite repo with a minimal SQL script; track the upstream issue ids on the bead (the maintainer already routes GH#257/GH#278 upstream).
5. Only after the run is green: either flip `fsqlite_concurrent_mode` on by default (with the 85 `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` sites reviewed) or document why it stays opt-in.
6. Rewrite README "Rust vs Python gauntlet" from the scorecard, with the date and hardware.

**Dependencies.** Gap 2 (engine strategy decision) determines which engine line the harness certifies; Gap 4 (verification) provides the runner and scorecard conventions. Upstream engine fixes gate the final green.
**Complexity.** XL.
**Vision goals served.** 5, 16, 22.
**Would existing beads close it?** No. `br-sa58k` (message-id election across processes), `br-pyalb` (GH#245 pool-timeout diagnostics), `br-22gm3` (Cx budgets into the DB layer), `br-htobc` and `br-9bwnb` cover pieces; no bead builds the harness or re-earns the README claim. New epic needed.

### Gap 2: Engine strategy (goal 7) — PARTIAL → DECIDED and enforced

**Current state.** VISION.md promises "FrankenSQLite only, no C SQLite". The runtime path is FrankenSQLite (`DbConn`, test-enforced by `normal_mailbox_connection_aliases_use_frankensqlite_runtime`), but `sqlmodel-sqlite` statically bundles C SQLite into every binary as a non-optional dependency of `mcp-agent-mail-db` and `-cli`, and the canonical engine is the verification oracle and recovery reader (`CanonicalDbConn`: doctor double probe, `neutralize_private_salvage_artifact`, backups, legacy import). The dual-engine seam is itself a defect source: mixed-engine fd-close lock destruction (`br-r6psd`), read-only canonical opens that cannot read a resting Franken WAL (`br-s9d8a`, class H), stale namespace records after promotion (fixed in `f85b22c2`), and the class-E1 refusals (mostly fixed by `pool::open_guarded_read_only_sqlite_file`). `fsqlite_raptorq_enabled` (config.rs:242) has no readers (`br-of0ra`).

**Target state.** ADR-004 records one of two strategies and the code enforces it: (a) "Franken runtime, canonical verifier": C SQLite is a declared, documented verification dependency; every cross-engine boundary goes through the dispatching opener or a private neutralized copy; VISION.md drops "no C SQLite"; or (b) "Franken only": canonical uses are replaced by Franken read-only probes plus an in-process page-level integrity check, `sqlmodel-sqlite` leaves the dependency graph, and a build gate forbids it.

**Success criteria.**
- [ ] `docs/ADR-004-engine-strategy.md` exists with the decision, the evidence from Gap 1's harness, and the list of every canonical use site with its disposition.
- [ ] Under (a): `rg 'open_guarded_read_only_(franken|canonical)_' crates` shows only the dispatcher, the two openers and deliberately engine-specific sites, each with a one-line justification comment; `docs/VISION.md` reality note replaced by the ADR link.
- [ ] Under (b): `cargo tree -p mcp-agent-mail-db | rg sqlmodel-sqlite` is empty and a `tests/docs_drift_ci.rs` case asserts it.
- [ ] Either way: the class-H tests (`br-s9d8a`, 6 doctor fixer tests) and class-B probes (`br-0dw2c`, 10 writer-lock tests) are green or rewritten to the invariant the ADR states, with the rewrite justified in the test.
- [x] Removed the unused erasure-coded recovery setting and its active vision promise (`br-of0ra`, 2026-09-20); the historical finding above describes the original audit snapshot.

**Implementation plan.**
1. Inventory every `CanonicalDbConn` use (`rg -n 'CanonicalDbConn' crates --type rust | wc -l` ≈ dozens) into a table: purpose, whether the input can be Franken-admitted, whether a private neutralized copy is used.
2. Decide (maintainer). The evidence to weigh: the class-B finding that Franken and canonical share no fcntl exclusion, the readonly_shm limitation, and how often canonical caught real corruption that Franken's own `integrity_check` missed (search the doctor artifacts under `~/.mcp_agent_mail_git_mailbox_repo/doctor/`).
3. Under (a): finish routing the remaining E1 sites (`cli::open_live_sqlite_read_only` / `open_sqlite_with_fallback` and their 13 callers; `tools::identity::open_health_check_sync_db_connection`; the cli index-repair classifier and physical probe); make `CanonicalDbConn` open sites accept only paths proven non-Franken-admitted (`pool::is_franken_admitted_family`) or private copies.
4. Under (b): implement a Franken-native full check (`PRAGMA integrity_check` through `DbConn` exists; add page-level header validation for the cases canonical caught), then delete canonical sites crate by crate, `sqlmodel-sqlite` last.
5. Completed the removal option for the unused recovery setting (`br-of0ra`, 2026-09-20).

**Dependencies.** Gap 1's harness supplies the evidence; Gap 4 supplies the class B/H test beads.
**Complexity.** L for (a), XL for (b).
**Vision goals served.** 7, 5, 16.
**Would existing beads close it?** Partially. `br-0dw2c`, `br-s9d8a`, `br-00gl8`, `br-of0ra`, `br-vhxdc` follow-ups, `br-yrjwh` (registry adoption), `br-yzk37` (inert pragmas) cover pieces; no bead holds the decision. New epic + ADR bead needed.

### Gap 3: Self-healing recovery that never wedges (goal 6) — PARTIAL → WORKING

**Current state.** Reconstruct promoted a real 2.7 GB mailbox in v0.3.32 and the 2026-09-01 wave fixed the breaker self-refusal inside a process's own recovery admission (`RecoveryAdmissionDepthGuard::active_for`), the false P0, the owner classifier, and the restored/reconstructed-family refusals. Still open: the breaker chain described by `br-plksu` (startup fail-open does not recognise the live-salvage refusal shape); a 1-message archive-ahead delta triggers a full rebuild (GH#284, `br-lwx55`); startup exits 1 into a systemd restart loop when an archive-ahead reconstruct is refused despite a healthy live DB (`br-bgwj1`); reservation parity reports permanent `missing_archive` drift after a reconstruct lineage (GH#244, `br-mc0hz`); the reference host still runs with `INTEGRITY_CHECK_ON_STARTUP=false`, 5.7 GB of recovery debris and 57 `pending_sends` artifacts; the pre-init reconcile can rebuild through a symlinked storage root because the server canonicalizes `config.storage_root` before pool init (the db-side `archive_has_real_projects` guard is not reached; strace-verified 2026-09-02); three artifact-hygiene tests stay red (`restore_from_backup_leaves_primary_untouched_when_staged_backup_is_invalid`, `sqlite_family_cleanup_refuses_before_mutation_while_writer_is_active`, `archive_recovery_noop_on_healthy_db`).

**Target state.** One classifier produces the mailbox verdict that doctor, robot, MCP health and startup all report; startup never crash-loops on a healthy file; small archive-ahead deltas apply incrementally; recovery leaves no artifact behind that a later probe misreads; the reference host runs with the startup integrity check on.

**Success criteria.**
- [ ] `am doctor health --json`, `am robot health --format json`, MCP `health_check` and the startup probe return the same `mailbox_verdict` on the same file in a table-driven test that covers: healthy Franken family, healthy sidecar-less family, resting WAL with live owner, restored `.bak`, reconstructed primary, corrupt header, half namespace pair.
- [ ] `br-lwx55`: an archive ahead by ≤ N messages is applied by inserting the missing rows (with the message-id floor) instead of rebuilding; a test asserts the primary inode is unchanged.
- [ ] `br-bgwj1` and `br-plksu`: startup with a healthy live DB and a refused archive-ahead reconstruct serves and logs, exit code 0; the breaker is armed only after an attempt fails, never provisionally.
- [ ] The symlinked-root test (`probe_integrity_does_not_recover_from_archive_through_symlinked_storage_root`) passes because the server refuses a symlinked configured root before canonicalizing.
- [ ] The three artifact-hygiene tests pass; `am doctor health` on the reference host is green with `INTEGRITY_CHECK_ON_STARTUP` unset.

**Implementation plan.**
1. Extract the verdict logic into `mcp_agent_mail_db::mailbox_verdict::compute_mailbox_verdict` as the single entry point (it exists; make the cli doctor, `robot health`, the server health route and `startup_checks::probe_integrity` call it instead of their own probes) and add the table-driven test.
2. `br-plksu` / `br-bgwj1`: in `pool.rs` recovery admission, record the breaker failure after the attempt (the provisional `record_failure` before the attempt is the root cause found on 2026-09-01), and teach `startup_checks::probe_integrity` the live-salvage refusal shape (`SqlError` messages beginning "reconstruct live salvage") as "serve, do not reinitialize".
3. `br-lwx55`: in `reconcile_archive_state_before_init`, when `archive_max_id - db_max_id ≤ N` and the project identities match, call a new `reconstruct::apply_archive_delta` that parses only the missing message files and inserts them under the promotion barrier.
4. Symlinked root: in `startup_checks.rs` (before `capture_pre_recovery_snapshot`), refuse `config.storage_root` that is a symlink or has a symlinked parent (`mcp_agent_mail_core::pane_identity::path_has_symlinked_parent` already exists) with a `ProbeFailure`, and stop canonicalizing it for pool init.
5. Artifact hygiene: `restore_from_backup` must remove its `.restoring-*` staging on rejection; `sqlite_family_cleanup` must not leave `.am-recovery-breaker.lock`; `archive_recovery_noop_on_healthy_db` needs the canonical immutable reader to see Franken WAL frames (checkpoint the private copy first) — each is a small fix in `pool.rs` with the existing red test as its acceptance.
6. Reference host: run `am doctor repair --yes` for the 5.7 GB debris and the 57 `pending_sends`, then re-enable the startup check and watch for 48 h.

**Dependencies.** None hard; Gap 2 decides how the canonical corroboration in the verdict is retained.
**Complexity.** L.
**Vision goals served.** 6, 11, 16.
**Would existing beads close it?** Partially: `br-plksu`, `br-lwx55`, `br-bgwj1`, `br-mc0hz`, `br-jcgxg`, `br-zchj0`, `br-oyget`, `br-3p187`, `br-sz6k9`, `br-cxsgx`. No bead for the unified verdict, the symlinked-root refusal, or the artifact-hygiene trio.

### Gap 4: Every test passes, zero ignored, zero flaky, one trusted gate (goal 16) — REGRESSED → WORKING

**Current state.** `br-l1q6z` recorded ~212 deterministic reds on 2026-09-01; the evening wave retired classes A, C, D, E2 and most of E1, but the figure has not been re-measured with a full-workspace `cargo nextest run`. Remaining classes with baselines measured in a detached worktree: B (10 cross-engine writer-lock probes, `br-0dw2c`), F (about 12 relative-`sqlite:///` authority tests across db/server/cli, `br-z73au`), H (6 readonly_shm tests, `br-s9d8a`), source-bytes (`br-00gl8` + `strict_query_only_pool_rejects_writes_without_changing_file_family`), symlink-rejection probes in the server (3), dashboard/TUI placeholder tests (3), cli doctor salvage fixture tests (6), setup self-heal OMP tests (3), and singletons (`insert_system_agent_reselects_existing_name_case_insensitively`, `commit_tx_does_not_wait_for_external_reader_checkpoint`). 39 `#[ignore]` remain (3 heavy stress, 3 engine-blocked, the rest unclassified). `run_http_startup_preflight_probes_omits_port_check` is flaky under load. Plain `cargo test` never trips the harness guard on ts1; only nextest does. GitHub `ci.yml` has never passed (0 of 1,785). The release scorecard the checklist requires (`tests/artifacts/release_scorecard/<ts>/release_scorecard.json`) has never been produced; installed-binary parity looks for `/usr/local/bin/am` and has never passed here.

**Target state.** A single documented gate, `cargo nextest run --workspace` (per-process) plus `am e2e run --project . --tag reliability --release-scorecard`, is green on the reference host before every tag, its artifacts are committed, and CI either runs that gate or is retired.

**Success criteria.**
- [ ] A full-workspace nextest run on ts1 reports 0 failures; the run log is attached to `br-l1q6z` before it closes.
- [ ] Every `#[ignore]` carries a reason string naming an upstream issue or a `--ignored` manual-run rationale; the count is pinned by a test so new ignores need a reason.
- [ ] `release_scorecard.json` exists for the next tag and `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` row 31 points at it; installed-binary parity resolves the `am` on `PATH` and passes.
- [ ] `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` states the gate in one paragraph; `cargo test` is documented as not sufficient for guard-sensitive code.

**Implementation plan.**
1. Re-measure: `cargo nextest run --workspace --no-fail-fast` on ts1 (private target dir), attach the summary to `br-l1q6z`, and update the class counts on the bead.
2. Class F (`br-z73au`): decide the `sqlite:///rel` contract in `mcp_agent_mail_core::disk::sqlite_file_path_from_database_url` (preserve a missing relative authority end to end); fix `resolve_mailbox_sqlite_path`, readiness, tool_metrics and search_v3 together; the ~12 tests are the acceptance.
3. Class B (`br-0dw2c`): per ADR-004, either take classic fcntl locks in the Franken write path or rewrite the 10 probes to the stated invariant.
4. Class H (`br-s9d8a`): stage the family and checkpoint the private copy before any canonical read (the pattern `neutralize_private_salvage_artifact` uses), applied in the doctor fixers' offline candidate path.
5. Server symlink probes (3) and the dashboard/TUI placeholder tests (3): investigate individually; each is a small contract fix or fixture fix with the red test as acceptance.
6. cli salvage fixtures (6): make `sqlite_backup_candidates` accept a Franken-written `.bak` by neutralizing a private copy, or fix the fixtures to write standalone backups; decide the `doctor_reconstruct_prefers_readable_current_db_as_salvage_source` wording contract.
7. Flakiness: run the suite 3× and quarantine-by-reason (not `#[ignore]`) anything that flips; fix `run_http_startup_preflight_probes_omits_port_check`.
8. Scorecard: run `am e2e run --project . --tag reliability --release-scorecard` on ts1, fix the installed-binary parity path resolution (`which am`), commit the artifacts, and add the two commands to the release checklist as blocking.

**Dependencies.** Gap 2 for classes B and H. Gap 8 (CI venue) for where the gate runs.
**Complexity.** L.
**Vision goals served.** 16, 17, 22.
**Would existing beads close it?** Partially: `br-l1q6z` (tracker), `br-z73au`, `br-0dw2c`, `br-s9d8a`, `br-00gl8`, `br-qk7wu` (closed by evidence), `br-99aih` (pollution guard landed, closure pending a full run), `br-jpowg`, `br-y1elw`, `br-nq2kb`. No bead for the ignore-reason policy, the flake quarantine, or the scorecard run.

## 2. Major gaps (the vision is significantly degraded)

### Gap 5: Delivery venues (goal 17) — PARTIAL → WORKING

**Current state.** Signed v0.3.32 shipped manually via dsr and verified; the installer verifies minisign manifests end to end (goal 18 WORKING). `ci.yml` 0 of 1,785 successes, silent since 2026-08-19 (queue latency then clippy failure); `dist.yml` 0 successes; `docker.yml` never green and ghcr's newest tag is v0.3.13 while the v0.3.31 changelog claimed the image was unstuck (CHANGELOG now carries a Known-issues note); `deploy-pages.yml` is now dispatch-only with a `bundle_dir` input but the Pages site still 404s; `publish.yml` is manual-only and `mcp-agent-mail` is not on crates.io; release binaries are built `--features portable` (lexical-only search).

**Target state.** Every workflow under `.github/workflows` either passes on its trigger or is deleted; the newest ghcr tag equals the newest release; the docs site deploys; crates.io publication is decided; the release checklist is executable from a clean checkout.

**Success criteria.**
- [ ] `gh run list --workflow <each>.yml --limit 5` shows green for every remaining workflow.
- [ ] `docker pull ghcr.io/dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail_rust:v<latest>` runs `am --version` matching the tag (`br-ocys6`).
- [ ] The Pages URL serves the bundle from `deploy-pages.yml`'s `bundle_dir`.
- [ ] `br-95spu` closed with a decision; if publishing, `cargo publish --dry-run` passes for every member crate in dependency order.

**Implementation plan.**
1. `br-bx73n`: decide the CI venue. Recommended: shrink `ci.yml` to fmt + clippy + `cargo nextest run -p mcp-agent-mail-core -p mcp-agent-mail-conformance` (fast subset) on the hosted runner, and move the full gate to a self-hosted rch-backed runner or document the local gate as the pre-tag requirement; delete `dist.yml` if dsr remains the release tool.
2. `br-ocys6`: add an image lane to the dsr flow (build `Dockerfile.release` from the verified release archives, push `v<tag>` and `latest`), or retract the claim permanently.
3. Pages: build `docs/site` with the existing tooling, dispatch `deploy-pages.yml` with `bundle_dir=docs/site`, verify the URL, then trigger it from the release flow.
4. `br-95spu`: decide; the blocker (frankensearch on crates.io) is gone, but the path deps on `../frankensearch-rel-0332` (`br-ku0kl`) must become registry deps first.
5. Search in binaries: ship one artifact with `--features hybrid` or state lexical-only in every doc that mentions search (README FAQ already does; AGENTS.md search caveat added); see Gap 9.

**Dependencies.** Gap 4 (the gate CI would run), Gap 9 (search feature decision), `br-ku0kl` (registry deps) for crates.io.
**Complexity.** M.
**Vision goals served.** 17, 13.
**Would existing beads close it?** Partially: `br-bx73n`, `br-ocys6`, `br-95spu`, `br-ku0kl`, `br-c2is6`, `br-gozln`, `br-nq2kb`, the P0 release-binding beads from Aug 25. No bead for Pages.

### Gap 6: Robot and operator surfaces correct at scale (goals 10, 11) — PARTIAL → WORKING

**Current state.** `am robot handoff` is fixed (0.30 s, `--max-seconds`); `am robot metrics` reads the live server. Still: `am robot overview` is slow at scale (GH#274); `/health` takes ~7 s on large mailboxes so doctor reports a healthy server as failing (`br-am-health-endpoint-slow-false-fail-45e0e`); `md` output exists only for `thread` and `message`; `doctor drain` and the ownership classifier now treat read-only readers correctly but `doctor locks` still reports the parallel-session `instest/am` daemon as the live owner without saying it is a test build; the doctor's diagnostic-source choice was only fixed on 2026-09-02 and has no table-driven test.

**Target state.** Every robot subcommand returns within 5 s on the 40k-message reference mailbox; no robot command returns constant zeros; `/health` is constant-time; the doctor's verdict on any family shape is table-tested.

**Success criteria.**
- [ ] A benchmark test (`crates/mcp-agent-mail-cli/tests/robot_scale.rs`, new) seeds 16 projects / 700 agents / 40k messages and asserts every `am robot <sub> --format json` finishes under 5 s.
- [ ] `/health` p99 < 250 ms on the same fixture (`br-am-health-endpoint-slow-false-fail-45e0e`).
- [ ] `md` renderers exist for every robot subcommand or the README states which support it.
- [ ] The doctor source-selection table test from Gap 3 covers `LiveLogicalSnapshot`, `StagedFamilyCopy`, `OfflineCanonical` and `PrivateCanonical` outcomes.

**Implementation plan.**
1. GH#274: apply the handoff pattern (batched join-free `IN (...)` lookups, wall-clock budget, `truncated_by_budget`) to `robot overview`; profile with the reference mailbox copy.
2. `/health`: cache the expensive counts behind a 30 s snapshot (the TUI poller throttle pattern, see `br-y8k4z`) and answer from the cached verdict; expose staleness in the payload.
3. Add the scale benchmark test with a generated fixture (reuse `open_robot_test_db_with_real_schema` and a bulk inserter).
4. `md` renderers: extend `robot.rs` output dispatch for the remaining subcommands.

**Dependencies.** Gap 3 for the shared verdict.
**Complexity.** M.
**Vision goals served.** 10, 11.
**Would existing beads close it?** Partially: `br-am-health-endpoint-slow-false-fail-45e0e`, `br-4myjj` (landed, verification pending), GH#274 has no bead. New beads for overview, md renderers, scale test.

### Gap 7: Search V3 hybrid in shipped artifacts (goal 13) — PARTIAL → WORKING

**Current state.** Hybrid (lexical + semantic) search exists in source builds behind the `hybrid` feature; every shipped artifact (dist.yml, both Dockerfiles) builds `--features portable`, so releases are lexical-only. Global search falls back to `LIKE` full scans after the FTS5 decommission (`br-7x5fm`). The workspace builds frankensearch from a gated clone `../frankensearch-rel-0332` because the live sibling moved to asupersync 0.4.10 while fastmcp pins =0.4.9 (`br-ku0kl`). Tantivy is not optional in db no-feature builds (`br-eh8bj`).

**Target state.** Either one shipped artifact carries hybrid search with a documented model download path, or every doc that mentions search says lexical-only for binaries; global search goes through Search V3 in both cases.

**Success criteria.**
- [ ] `br-7x5fm`: `am search` and the `search_messages` tool never issue `LIKE '%…%'` full scans on the reference mailbox (assert via `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` in a test).
- [ ] Decision recorded: hybrid artifact (with `am search --semantic` proven in an e2e suite on a release binary) or lexical-only statement in README, AGENTS.md and `am --help`.
- [ ] `br-ku0kl` closed: path deps replaced by registry versions once fastmcp follows asupersync, with `dist.yml`/Dockerfile/install.sh updated in the same change.

**Implementation plan.**
1. Route global search through the Search V3 planner (`search_planner`, `search_service`) and remove the LIKE fallback path.
2. Decide the artifact feature set with the maintainer; if hybrid, add a `hybrid` build to the dsr release flow and an e2e suite that runs semantic search on the produced binary with the bundled model.
3. Watch fastmcp for an asupersync ≥ 0.4.10 release; then bump asupersync in lockstep, switch frankensearch to registry deps, and retire the clone.

**Dependencies.** Gap 5 (release flow) for the artifact; upstream fastmcp for the registry move.
**Complexity.** M.
**Vision goals served.** 13, 17.
**Would existing beads close it?** Partially: `br-7x5fm`, `br-ku0kl`, `br-eh8bj`. No bead for the artifact decision.

### Gap 8: ATC learning loop live and safe by default (goal 14) — PARTIAL → WORKING

**Current state.** `atc_note_*` hooks are wired from dispatch; the executor default flipped to Shadow on 2026-08-28. `atc_record_outcome()` has zero production callers although README named it as the outcome path (README now says the real path is `record_atc_message_outcome_from_tool_payload_with_pool`). GH#264 stays open: one field mailbox is 99.8% ATC self-traffic (`br-au76r`); GH#258 hydration stalls MCP (`br-z6m08`); the default pairing decision is open (`br-rl1s4`). The parallel session landed the complete `AM_ATC_*` flag registry and runbooks on 2026-09-01 (`a3a52caf`).

**Target state.** A fresh default install produces zero ATC mail in a 24 h soak; hydration is bounded; probe traffic has its own retention or state; the outcome path has one name.

**Success criteria.**
- [ ] `br-rl1s4` closed with the decision and the shipped default documented in `docs/FLAGS_REGISTRY.md`.
- [ ] A soak test (reuse the Gap 1 harness at low rate) shows 0 ATC-authored messages in ordinary inboxes over 24 h with defaults.
- [ ] `br-z6m08`: cold-start hydration is bounded by effect-queue capacity with a test at 940 recent agents.
- [ ] `atc_record_outcome` is deleted or called; README, AGENTS and the code agree.

**Implementation plan.**
1. Decide the default pairing (maintainer) and encode it in `Config` defaults + the flag registry.
2. `br-au76r`: route liveness probes to a dedicated state table or a retention class that never lands in agent inboxes.
3. `br-z6m08`: cap hydration by queue capacity, spill the rest to a background pass.
4. Remove or wire `atc_record_outcome`.

**Dependencies.** Gap 1 harness for the soak.
**Complexity.** M.
**Vision goals served.** 14.
**Would existing beads close it?** Mostly: `br-rl1s4`, `br-au76r`, `br-z6m08`; missing: the soak criterion and the dead-function cleanup.

### Gap 9: Read-only MCP resources honour their contract (goal 2) — PARTIAL → WORKING

**Current state.** 25 templates served and test-pinned. `resource://tooling/recent/{window_seconds}` always returns an empty list (`resources.rs:2129`, "not yet implemented; return real data only"); 7 of 8 `?{query}` variants parse and discard their parameters; conformance fixtures cover 23 of 25 while README says all 25 (`br-ciwph`).

**Target state.** Every resource either honours its documented parameters or is delisted from the registry, the fixtures and the docs, consistently.

**Success criteria.**
- [ ] `tooling/recent` returns the last N tool calls from a bounded in-memory ring the server already feeds for the TUI timeline, filtered by agent/project, with a unit test; or it is removed from `TOOL_CLUSTER_MAP`-equivalent resource registry, the Python fixture and README in one change.
- [ ] Each `?query` variant either applies its parameters (test per variant) or returns a typed `unsupported parameter` error.
- [ ] Conformance fixtures cover 25 of 25 or README says 23.

**Implementation plan.** As in `br-ciwph`.
**Dependencies.** None.
**Complexity.** S–M.
**Vision goals served.** 2.
**Would existing beads close it?** Yes: `br-ciwph`.

### Gap 10: Legacy Python import and upgrade (goal 19) — PARTIAL → WORKING

**Current state.** `am legacy detect/import/status` and `am upgrade` exist with tests. GH#268: `serve-http` fails after a successful import on its own fsqlite namespace gate (Kubernetes PVC repro, `br-lkhxw`); several P1 beads cover clobber-free publication of import artifacts (`br-1m1tv`, `br-8echk`, `br-hb3mk`, `br-cxsgx`).

**Target state.** Import → serve works on a PVC-style filesystem in an e2e suite; failed imports are retryable.

**Success criteria.**
- [ ] An e2e suite imports a Python-era mailbox fixture and then serves over HTTP from the same directory, on ext4 and on an overlay/bind mount that mimics the PVC report.
- [ ] `br-lkhxw` closed with that suite as evidence.

**Implementation plan.** Reproduce GH#268 with the dispatcher in place (the namespace-gate refusal is the same family as class E1: after import the family may be sidecar-less or carry stale records — apply `admit_private_database_with_franken` or the promotion-style record retirement at import publication), then the P1 clobber beads.
**Dependencies.** Gap 2 (namespace semantics).
**Complexity.** M.
**Vision goals served.** 19.
**Would existing beads close it?** Mostly: `br-lkhxw` + the four P1 beads; missing: the PVC e2e suite.

### Gap 11: Performance baselines current and honoured (goal 22) — UNPROVEN → WORKING

**Current state.** README performance tables are the 2026-02 numbers; the latest artifacts (2026-09-01) show archive batch-100 p95 of 6.5 s against a 250 ms budget; `benches/BUDGETS.md` deliberately leaves budgets unrecalibrated; the p99 budget for the swarm test was recalibrated from the README's 6.8 s to 120 s; `br-pyalb` (GH#245) asks for windowed timeout diagnostics and `git_commit_p99` exposure (the timeout payload now carries `git_commit_p99_ms`, seen on 2026-09-02).

**Target state.** Budgets reflect the current engine on named hardware, the bench suite fails when a budget regresses, and README tables carry current numbers with the date and host.

**Success criteria.**
- [ ] `benches/BUDGETS.md` has a per-case budget with a recorded baseline run id; `cargo bench`/the bench e2e suite exits non-zero on a > 20 % regression.
- [ ] README performance tables regenerated from `tests/artifacts/bench/<ts>/` with an era note.
- [ ] Gap 1's scorecard numbers (reservation grant p99, tool p99) become budgets.

**Implementation plan.** Run the bench catalog on ts1 after Gap 1's fixes; write budgets from the measured p95 × 1.5; wire the check into the release checklist; regenerate the README tables by script (a doc generator, not a hand edit).
**Dependencies.** Gap 1.
**Complexity.** S–M.
**Vision goals served.** 22.
**Would existing beads close it?** No bead; `br-pyalb` is adjacent.

### Gap 12: Deterministic fixtures and the parallel-session workflow (goals 16, 23) — REGRESSED → WORKING

**Current state.** On 2026-09-01 a second Claude session working in the same checkout committed this session's in-progress working tree under its own message (`888aea20`), left the cli lib tests uncompilable (E0027) and two clippy doc lints; 66 in-progress beads have been untouched since Aug 25–28; `bv --robot-triage` returns null on this host (`br-cdwya` adjacent).

**Target state.** Concurrent sessions cannot publish each other's edits, the tracker reflects live work, and `bv` triage works.

**Success criteria.**
- [ ] AGENTS.md "Typical Agent Flow" gains: reserve files via Agent Mail before editing, commit only your own paths (`git add <paths>`, never `-A` in a shared checkout), run `git status -sb` and `git log -3` before committing.
- [ ] Every in-progress bead older than 7 days without a comment is released to open or tombstoned; `bv --robot-triage | jq .quick_ref` returns data.
- [ ] Each epic from this plan exists as a bead with children; `br ready` surfaces plan work first.

**Implementation plan.** Docs edit; a one-time tracker sweep by the maintainer (claims belong to other agents); fix `bv` on this host (`br-cdwya`).
**Dependencies.** None.
**Complexity.** S.
**Vision goals served.** 23.
**Would existing beads close it?** No.

### Gap 13: The live daemon's reservation path (goal 5, operator-visible) — NEW → WORKING

Listed separately from Gap 1 because it is reproducible today without a harness: `file_reservation_paths` (5 paths, ttl 10800) timed out twice at 30 s on 2026-09-02 with `stage=blocking_dispatch_unattributed`, `blocking_dispatch_inflight=1`, pool/db/archive p99s in single-digit ms, `blocking_dispatch_timeouts_total` 12 → 13, while `release_file_reservations` returned in milliseconds (`br-9bwnb`).

**Target state.** Reservation grants are bounded and attributed.
**Success criteria.** As on `br-9bwnb`.
**Implementation plan.** Instrument the blocking-dispatch lane with the stage name and elapsed per step (conflict scan over `file_reservations/*.json`, artifact write, DB insert, coalescer enqueue); reproduce on a copy of the reference mailbox (1k+ reservation artifacts); bound the conflict scan with an index (reservation patterns per project are already in the DB) instead of a directory walk.
**Dependencies.** None.
**Complexity.** M.
**Vision goals served.** 5, 10.
**Would existing beads close it?** Yes: `br-9bwnb` (new).

## 3. Minor gaps (polish, completeness, hygiene)

### Gap 14: Docs are the truth for the shipped surface (goal 21) — PARTIAL → WORKING

**Current state.** README/AGENTS counts, flags, dependency table and the `DATABASE_URL` default were corrected on 2026-09-01 and `doc_consistency` now pins doctor verbs, robot subcommands and themes. Still outside the guard: the bench catalog names, the resource-coverage sentence, the ATC outcome-path name, the README perf era note, and three root-level planning docs that diverge from their `docs/planning` copies (`AGENT_MAIL_RUST_VERSION_REPO_TRANSITION_PLAN.md`, `PROPOSED_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SYNC_STRATEGY.md`, plus `FEATURE_PARITY.md`, `PLAN_TO_PORT…`, `TODO*.md`, `UPGRADE_LOG.md`, `beads_*.md` duplicated at the root).

**Target state.** Every count or name the docs state is either generated from a registry or pinned by `doc_consistency`; planning docs live once, under `docs/planning`.

**Success criteria.**
- [ ] `doc_consistency` pins: bench case names (from the bench catalog), resource fixture coverage (from the conformance fixture set), the ATC outcome function name (grep), and the perf-table era note.
- [ ] Root-level duplicates are moved (git mv, never deleted) under `docs/planning/` with the diverged copies reconciled; `br-4meup` closed.

**Implementation plan.** Extend `crates/mcp-agent-mail-conformance/tests/doc_consistency.rs` (the `LiveCounts` pattern) with the four probes; `git mv` the duplicates after a diff review.
**Dependencies.** None.
**Complexity.** S.
**Vision goals served.** 21.
**Would existing beads close it?** Partially: `br-4meup`.

### Gap 15: Workspace lints everywhere — NEW → WORKING

**Current state.** Five crates (cli, share, storage, guard, conformance; about 250k lines) do not inherit `[workspace.lints]` (`br-sox5q`); clippy with `-D warnings` is only clean for them because their own lint sets are weaker.
**Target state.** All member crates inherit `[workspace.lints]`; the pedantic/nursery baseline is met or allowed per-lint with a comment.
**Success criteria.** `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean with the five manifests carrying `[lints] workspace = true`.
**Implementation plan.** Per crate: add the inheritance, fix or allow lint by lint, one commit per crate.
**Complexity.** M (mechanical, large).
**Vision goals served.** 16.
**Would existing beads close it?** Yes: `br-sox5q`.

### Gap 16: Canonical Python repo cut over to Rust-first (goal 20) — NOT STARTED → DECIDED

**Current state.** `docs/planning/AGENT_MAIL_RUST_VERSION_REPO_TRANSITION_PLAN.md` says Active; the Rust-side pieces exist; the Python repo README still describes the FastMCP server; no PR (`br-ajiq8`).
**Target state.** Phase 1 of the transition plan executed (canary cutover PR from `docs/OLD_REPO_RUST_CUTOVER_PR_BODY.md`) or the plan marked superseded in the README FAQ.
**Success criteria.** `br-ajiq8` closed with a PR link or a dated "superseded" status in the plan and the FAQ.
**Complexity.** S (decision) + M (execution).
**Vision goals served.** 20.
**Would existing beads close it?** Yes: `br-ajiq8`.

### Gap 17: Dead flags and documented-but-dead functions — NEW → WORKING

The unused recovery setting was removed with its active documentation (`br-of0ra`, 2026-09-20; see Gap 2). `atc_record_outcome` (Gap 8) remains a separate task: wire it with a test or remove it with its docs.
**Complexity.** S. **Beads:** `br-of0ra`; ATC cleanup needs a child bead under Gap 8.

### Gap 18: TUI and web polish (goals 8, 9) — WORKING → WORKING (guard)

Both goals work. Keep them working: the TUI snapshot suite is red against the frankentui main tip (`br-boq46`), the poller's full-snapshot sweep bypasses its throttle (`br-y8k4z`), and the read-only attach banner should print the reclaim command (`br-mljnz`). README should list the 42 themes by name from `NAMED_THEMES` (generated) rather than a hand-written five.
**Complexity.** S. **Beads:** yes (`br-boq46`, `br-y8k4z`, `br-mljnz`).

### Gap 19: Reference-host operational debt — NEW → CLEAN

The maintainer's own machine is not a clean oracle: `INTEGRITY_CHECK_ON_STARTUP=false`, 5.7 GB recovery debris (4.9 GB reclaimable staging), 57 `pending_sends` artifacts, 45 zero-byte `-fsqlite-ns-gate.corrupt*` sidecars, and a daemon served by another session's `instest/am` test build (observed 2026-09-02 via `am doctor locks`).
**Success criteria.** `am doctor health` green on the reference host with defaults; the daemon is the installed release binary; the debris is quarantined or reclaimed through `am doctor repair`/`vacuum`, never by hand.
**Complexity.** S (after Gap 3).

## 5. Verification plan (one line per vision goal)

| # | Goal | How it is proven when the plan is done |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 45 real tools | `am doctor mcp-selftest --format json` = 45, plus `TOOL_CLUSTER_MAP` test (already green) |

---

## 6. Decisions only the maintainer can make

1. ADR-004 engine strategy: dual-engine with a declared verifier, or Franken-only (Gap 2).
2. CI venue: repair `ci.yml` to a runnable subset, or retire GitHub Actions in favour of the local gate (Gap 5, `br-bx73n`).
3. Container image: publish through dsr or retract the claim (`br-ocys6`).
4. crates.io publication (`br-95spu`) and the registry move for frankensearch (`br-ku0kl`).
5. Shipped search features: hybrid artifact or lexical-only statement (Gap 7).
6. ATC default pairing (`br-rl1s4`).
7. Python repo cutover (`br-ajiq8`).
8. Release of the 66 stale in-progress bead claims (Gap 12).

## 7. Explicitly out of scope for this plan

- The WASM dashboard epic (the only open epic today) — not a vision goal in README/AGENTS/VISION.
- Windows-specific recovery parity (`br-y1elw`) beyond keeping its tests honest.
- Rewriting the storage engine; upstream FrankenSQLite defects are reported, not fixed here.

## 8. Provenance

Phase 1 sources: full reads of AGENTS.md, README.md, VISION.md, every root and `docs/planning` plan, `docs/VERIFICATION_COVERAGE_LEDGER.md`, `RELIABILITY_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md`, `DOCTOR_FM_DISPOSITION.md`, `FRANKENSQLITE_PRAGMA_GAPS.md`, `CONFORMANCE_AUDIT_2026-04-18.md`, `RELEASE_TRAIN_PLAN.md`, the April reality check; five parallel code audits; the 2026-09-01 nextest logs; live probes on ts1. Phase 2 sources: the 2026-09-01/02 landing lanes (baselines in a detached worktree at `ba1b8a42`, nextest summaries on `f85b22c2`), `br list` on 2026-09-02 (108 open, 66 in-progress, 2248 closed, 208 tombstoned), and the strace trace of the symlinked-root recovery.
