# GH274: integrated cold overview collection

The first sections below record the initial collector's historical evidence.
Later sections cover bounded recipient counts and counts-only reservation
presence. Measurements cover different phases and must not be compounded.

Implementation commit: `32b40410dcb248129c4e7fa74a6a3c5544fac5f6`.
Evidence recorded on 2026-09-18. This is SQL-work evidence, not a native CLI
latency claim.

## Production change

`robot::handle_robot` now routes overview and overview --counts through the
live collector in `src/robot/overview.rs`. Other commands use the preserved
implementation in `robot_commands.rs` (original Git blob
`f8ca6f74bb4621882b71ef8148a156752e5e9cb5`).

The cold command no longer computes the whole-mailbox generation fingerprint
before consulting a process-local cache. Five narrow data scans replace the
recipient/message JOIN and GROUP BY and the orphan-project discovery joins.
Additional reads probe the reservation schema and read the release ledger;
"five scans" does not mean five total SQL statements. A Rust hash map matches
recipient rows to message metadata, and release-ledger membership is checked
in a fresh hash set. The existing guarded database opener is retained.

A nested read savepoint covers collection and is released on success or query
failure. Counters are recalculated on every call, including expiry/overdue
changes without writes and read/ack edits that do not advance a maximum
observed timestamp. The counts/full JSON and TOON output use the original
public envelope and formatting functions. Native tests pin legacy/ledger
schema variants, null-versus-zero semantics, strict boundaries, orphan
visibility, read-only transactions, and output shape.

## Executed diagnostic

Run from a checkout containing the production change:

```sh
python3 scripts/verify_gh274_overview.py
```

Eight Python test methods passed, including 100 seeded differential fixtures,
input-row scaling, actual two-connection canonical SQLite WAL snapshot
visibility, outer-transaction preservation, and error cleanup. The four core
SQL projections are extracted from the Rust source; application-side matching
is independently implemented in Python. These are not executions of Rust.

Canonical SQLite 3.46.1, `set_progress_handler` with instruction interval 1:

| Projects | Messages | Recipients | Previous cold SQL VM instructions | New SQL VM instructions | Recipient lookups |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 10 | 30 | 1,883 | 550 | 20 |
| 10 | 100 | 300 | 17,075 | 5,113 | 200 |
| 50 | 500 | 1,500 | 84,595 | 25,393 | 1,000 |
| 50 | 24,000 | 72,000 | 3,985,595 | 1,200,393 | 48,000 |

Each scaling fixture has one expired reservation per message. The large case
therefore has 24,000 expired reservations. Old/new results compare exactly.
The large case executes about 69.9% fewer canonical SQL VM instructions.

The previous-cold model includes the former generation query plus the old
live collector's query shapes. The new model uses the narrow projections and
release/reservation reads. VM counts exclude application hash work, SQL
schema probes, savepoint-control overhead, database opening, and CLI startup.
The fixture uses the ledger-only schema and does not reproduce every
production index. Neither these numbers nor the Python test run time are a
FrankenSQLite/Rust speedup measurement; native planner and allocation costs
can differ materially.

## Native validation still required

Eight Rust regressions and one ignored native DbConn benchmark are added. The
read-only workflow also targets the existing separate-process CLI mutation
test in `integration_runs`. Correct commands are:

```sh
cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --lib robot::overview::tests -- --nocapture
cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --test it integration_runs::robot_overview_cold_processes -- --nocapture
cargo test --release -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --lib benchmark_linear_overview_against_current_main -- --ignored --nocapture
```

The native benchmark compares old/new live collectors with alternating run
order, not CLI startup. Its speedup assertion is opt-in. It does not include
the removed cache-generation cost. A smaller fixture can be selected with
`AM_OVERVIEW_BENCH_MESSAGES_PER_PROJECT=48` (default 480).

Rust compilation, rustfmt, Clippy, native tests, and native timing were not run
in the editing environment: no Rust toolchain was available. GitHub reported
no workflow runs for the implementation commit when checked. Do not close
GH274 on a claim of measured native latency from this diagnostic.

## Scope and tradeoffs

This is not a persistent or per-project incremental cache. A cold overview
still reads narrow metadata across the mailbox. Rust memory now includes the
message map and returned recipient rows; the collector reduces engine query
work by doing matching in application memory, not by making large mailboxes
constant-cost. No body text or reservation path payload is fetched. The
previously fixed reservation anti-join remains absent.

## Indexed recipient counts: 702f1b3e (2026-09-18)

This follow-up builds on the bounded keyset collector already on `a20df51d`.
The remaining recipient predicate was `read_ts IS NULL OR ack_ts IS NULL`.
Read messages that never required acknowledgement still have NULL `ack_ts`,
so every overview kept returning those historical recipients and fetching
message metadata that could not contribute to any counter.

The live path now uses existing full indexes with prefixes `(ack_required,
id)` and `(ack_ts, message_id)`. After a strategy sample of at most 256 pending
recipient rows, the sparse path collects unread recipients and counts
read-but-unacknowledged recipients only for overdue, ack-required messages.
The latter query groups one table for at most 256 message IDs at a time; it
has no JOIN and returns at most 256 groups even with large recipient fanout.
Unread recipients contribute overdue counts in the first pass and are
excluded from the second, so they cannot be counted twice.

Missing/unsuitable indexes use the unchanged bounded scanner. An unread-heavy
sample also selects that scanner, avoiding an additional acknowledgement
message walk on an all-unread mailbox. The sample affects only the choice of
exact algorithm, not which records count. It is a heuristic, not a guarantee
of the cheapest plan for every distribution. No read path creates indexes.
All phases remain under the same existing read savepoint.

Reproduce the recipient-phase diagnostic with:

```sh
python3 scripts/verify_gh274_sparse_recipients.py
```

Eight Python test methods passed, including 200 deterministic randomized
fixtures with assertions that both strategy branches execute. Other cases
cover fanout, signed keys, NULL/zero timestamps, time transitions, below-max
read/ack mutations, index fallback, error cleanup, caller transactions, and
a real two-connection canonical SQLite WAL mutation between the two passes.
The script extracts projections and predicates from the committed Rust
modules and records their SHA-256 hashes. Its control flow is independently
implemented in Python; it does not execute the Rust code.

Measured with canonical SQLite 3.46.1, one progress callback per VM instruction.
The fixture contains 33 project IDs, 24,000 read non-ack-required historical
messages and 33 overdue ack-required messages with three recipients each:
24,033 messages and 24,099 recipients total.

| Recipient-phase measurement | Previous bounded scanner | Indexed strategy |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Data statements | 190 | 5 |
| Message metadata rows returned | 24,033 | 33 |
| All data rows returned, including sample and grouped counts | 48,099 | 388 |
| Canonical SQL VM instructions | 820,120 | 79,303 |

The VM reduction is approximately 90.3%. Data-statement and returned-row
counts exclude schema/savepoint probes; the VM totals include those probes
within the diagnostic phase. All figures exclude project inventory,
reservations, opening the database, CLI startup and application-side work.
They are not a FrankenSQLite latency or native CLI speedup measurement.

An adverse comparison changes every message to ack-required and every
recipient to unread/unacknowledged. The strategy selects the old scanner:
190 versus 191 data statements, and 868,451 versus 872,327 canonical VM
instructions (approximately 0.45% added work for the selection check).

Nine native regressions and an ignored native recipient-phase benchmark are
included in `overview/sparse_recipients.rs`. The benchmark alternates run
order and compares the actual old/new Rust helpers on one indexed fixture.

```sh
cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --lib robot::overview -- --nocapture
cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --test it integration_runs::robot_overview_cold_processes -- --nocapture
cargo test --release -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --lib benchmark_sparse_recipient_counts_against_pending_row_scan -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Native compilation, tests, rustfmt, Clippy and native timings remain unrun in
the editing environment, which has no Rust toolchain. The optimization still
requires an engine-side scan to filter unread recipients, can walk historical
ack-required messages, and adds index-metadata probes. Apart from the bounded
strategy sample, it avoids returning read non-ack recipient history or
looking up those messages. It does not implement persistent counters or
cross-process cache reuse. GH274 still needs native/original-corpus latency
validation before a conclusive performance-closure claim.

## Counts-only reservation presence: d8dbb76f

`overview --counts` does not return reservation totals, but still performed
full reservation collection before trimming its output. The live router now
selects `build_counts_output` before collection. It shares project inventory,
recipient counts, output formatting and the read savepoint with full overview;
only the reservation phase differs. Full overview still counts every active,
unreleased reservation as before.

Known projects (including agent/message orphans) are already counted regardless
of their reservations. The new phase checks only whether additional project
IDs have at least one active, unreleased reservation. It initially consumes
up to four bounded 256-row candidate pages, ignoring release-ledger lookups for
known projects. For a small inventory with a verified full project-leading
index, it then seeks gaps between known integer IDs. Each newly found ID is
checked for active, unreleased presence, stopping when that presence is proven.
Contiguous known IDs require only the two outer gap seeks. No index is created
and no mailbox-wide SQL anti-join or exclusion list is introduced.

Discovery has strategy budgets. If the schema lacks a suitable index, the
known inventory is broad, too many unknown IDs need checking, or a released
orphan prefix exhausts its page allowance, the phase completes with the exact
bounded scan. These limits never truncate results or hide a late active
reservation. Membership makes rereads idempotent. NULL/zero release-ledger
membership, legacy sentinels, strict expiry and signed ID boundaries retain
their existing semantics. Partial reservation fields never escape through the
public full-output path: the specialized entry point renders counts only.

Reproduce the diagnostic:

```sh
python3 scripts/verify_gh274_counts.py
```

Eight Python test methods passed, including 240 seeded differential fixtures
against an independent straight-scan oracle. Assertions cover small-set,
indexed and fallback strategies, schema variants, known/agent/message/orphan
project sources, sparse and extreme signed IDs, unsuitable indexes, late
unreleased candidates after long released prefixes, budget exhaustion,
read-only access, outer transactions and cleanup after SQL failures. A real
two-connection canonical SQLite WAL test releases one orphan's reservation and
inserts another during gap discovery: the current snapshot retains the old
inventory and the next call sees the new one. Separate connection opens also
verify release, insert and expiry changes. These are not native CLI processes.

The script extracts SQL projections and budgets from the committed Rust
sources and records their SHA-256 hashes. Python models the control flow;
this is NOT execution of Rust or FrankenSQLite. Measurements below use
canonical SQLite 3.46.1, one progress callback per VM instruction, a minimal
indexed ledger-only schema, and already-known project IDs 1 through 33.
Every reservation is unexpired but released through the ledger.

| Reservation-phase measurement | Full collection, 24,000 rows | Counts-only, 24,000 rows | Full collection, 240,000 rows | Counts-only, 240,000 rows |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Data statements | 189 | 6 | 1,877 | 6 |
| Reservation candidate rows returned | 24,000 | 1,024 | 240,000 | 1,024 |
| Release-ledger rows returned | 24,000 | 0 | 240,000 | 0 |
| Canonical SQL VM instructions | 434,267 | 8,100 | 4,344,211 | 8,100 |

For these fixtures, canonical VM work falls by approximately 98.1% and 99.8%.
The same project inventory is returned. Data-statement counts omit schema and
savepoint probes; VM counts include them. All figures exclude project and
recipient collection, application-side work, database opening, formatting and
CLI startup. Index height and native-engine planner costs can still vary as
the corpus grows. These are not end-to-end or native latency measurements.

Adverse cases are reported rather than discarded. With 24,000 released rows
belonging entirely to an unknown project, the strategy falls back and needs
206 versus 189 data statements, with 470,107 versus 434,267 canonical VM
instructions (about 8.3% extra work). Without a suitable project index, the
33-known-project fixture rereads its initial pages, but skips the ledger:
99 statements and 201,233 VM instructions versus 189 and 434,264. Empty active
sets take one data query in both paths. The strategy is not guaranteed to win
for every distribution, and its budgets bound discovery attempts and Rust
result buffers, not engine-internal memory or wall-clock execution time.

Nine native regression tests and an ignored comparison benchmark live in
`overview/counts_reservations.rs`. The benchmark alternates the actual full
and counts-only reservation helpers on the same indexed DbConn fixture.

```sh
cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --lib robot::overview -- --nocapture
cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --test it integration_runs::robot_overview_cold_processes -- --nocapture
cargo test --release -p mcp-agent-mail-cli --lib benchmark_counts_reservations_against_full_collection -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Rust compilation, native tests, rustfmt and Clippy remain unrun in the editing
environment: no Rust toolchain is available. The global unread-recipient scan
is unchanged; no read-state index migration or persistent cache was added.
GH274 still requires native/original-corpus latency validation for closure.
