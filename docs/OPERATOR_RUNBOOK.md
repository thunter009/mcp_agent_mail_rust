## 1. Quick Start

```bash
# Default: MCP transport, localhost:8765, TUI enabled
am serve-http

# API transport mode
am serve-http --path api

# Custom host/port
am serve-http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000

# Headless (server only, no TUI)
mcp-agent-mail serve --no-tui

# Skip authentication
am serve-http --no-auth
```

The `am serve-http` command sets `LOG_RICH_ENABLED=true` and auto-discovers
`HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN` from the user env file. Resolution order:
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mcp-agent-mail/config.env`, then
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mcp-agent-mail/.env`, then `~/.mcp_agent_mail/.env`
(fallback: `~/mcp_agent_mail/.env`).

### CLI vs Server Binaries (Dual-Mode)

This repo intentionally keeps **MCP server** and **CLI** command surfaces separate:

- MCP server: `mcp-agent-mail` (default: MCP stdio; `serve` for HTTP; `config` for debugging)
- CLI: `am` (built from the `mcp-agent-mail-cli` crate)

The most common mistake is trying to run CLI-only commands through the MCP server binary.
In that case, `mcp-agent-mail` should deny on `stderr` and exit with code `2` (usage error).

Examples:

```bash
# Wrong binary (denied, exit 2)
cargo run -p mcp-agent-mail -- share deploy verify-live https://example.github.io/agent-mail

# Correct binary (CLI)
cargo run -p mcp-agent-mail-cli -- --help   # runs `am`
```

Note: `am serve-http` is the native CLI command for starting the HTTP server with TUI. It is distinct from the `am` CLI subcommands used for operator tasks.

## 2. Pre-Flight Checklist

Before starting, verify:

| Check           | How to verify                                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Port ownership  | `ss -tlnp \| grep 8765` (reuse existing Agent Mail if live) |
| Storage dir     | `ls -la $STORAGE_ROOT` or `ls -la ~/.local/share/mcp-agent-mail/` (writable) |
| Database URL    | `echo $DATABASE_URL` (defaults to `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./storage.sqlite3`) |
| Auth token      | Check `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mcp-agent-mail/config.env` or `~/.mcp_agent_mail/.env` |
| Disk space      | `df -h .` (>100 MB free)                                   |

If port `8765` is already used by Agent Mail, reuse it instead of force-killing.
Use a different port only when intentionally running an isolated second server.

The server runs startup probes automatically. If any fail, it prints
remediation hints and exits. Probes check:

- **http-path**: Must start and end with `/` (e.g., `/mcp/`)
- **port**: Must be bindable (not in use, not privileged without root)
- **storage**: Directory must exist and be writable
- **database**: URL must be valid and database reachable
- **sqlite-integrity**: `PRAGMA quick_check` must pass

## 3. Keyboard Controls

### Global (always active)

| Key | Action | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| `1`-`9` | Jump to screens 1-9 | Suppressed during text input |
| `0` | Jump to screen 10 | Projects screen |

| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Next/previous screen | Cycles through all 16 screens |
| `Ctrl+P` | Command palette | Always available outside text-entry conflicts |
| `:` | Command palette | Suppressed during text input |
| `/` | Global search deep link | Opens Search with query focus |
| `.` | Contextual action menu | Uses focused row/entity actions |
| `Ctrl+N` | Open compose overlay | Global compose panel |

| `?` | Toggle help overlay | Includes screen and global keymaps |
| `q` | Quit | Immediate when not blocked by overlays |
| `Esc` | Dismiss overlay / close toast focus | Also used for quit-confirm flow |

### Screen-Specific

Each screen has its own keybindings shown in the bottom hint bar and
accessible via `?`. Common patterns:

- `j`/`k` or `Up`/`Down` — Navigate rows
- `Space`/`v`/`A`/`C` — Toggle/extend/select-all/clear multi-select (batch-capable screens)
- `Ctrl+S`/`Ctrl+L` — Save/load filter presets (Messages, Reservations, Timeline)
- `Enter` — Inspect/open selected item (screen-dependent deep links)
- `.` — Open contextual action menu on focused row

### 3.1 Command Palette Usage

Use the palette (`Ctrl+P` or `:`) for fast, low-friction control:

1. Open palette and type fuzzy text (screen/tool/agent/project/thread/reservation).
2. Use arrow keys + `Enter` to execute actions.
3. Prefer palette when direct jump keys are ambiguous (especially screens 11-16).
4. Use palette for transport/layout/macro actions to keep workflows deterministic.

### 3.2 Toast Focus Mode

Enter toast focus mode with `Ctrl+Y` when multiple notifications are active.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j`/`Down` | Next toast |
| `k`/`Up` | Previous toast |
| `Enter` | Dismiss focused toast |
| `m` | Mute/unmute toasts (runtime) |
| `Esc` | Exit toast focus mode |

### 3.3 High-Signal Screen Keys

- Messages: `g` toggles Local/Global inbox mode; `c` opens compose; `Ctrl+M` marks read; `Ctrl+V` drops to thread.
- Threads: `e/c` expands/collapses all message cards; `Left/Right` collapses/expands selected branch.
- Timeline: `V` cycles Events/Commits/Combined; lowercase `v` toggles visual selection mode.
- Search: `f` focuses facet rail; use `j/k` + `Enter` to cycle scope/sort/field facets.
- Contacts: `n` toggles Table/Graph; `g` toggles Mermaid panel.
- Reservations: `n` opens create-reservation form.
- ATC: `d` opens decision detail; `r` opens the retention report.

## 4. Screens Reference

| # | Screen       | Purpose                                           |
|---|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Dashboard    | Event stream, anomaly rail, throughput and triage summary |
| 2 | Messages     | Inbox/outbox triage, presets, compose/reply, detail pane |
| 3 | Threads      | Thread correlation and conversation drill-down |
| 4 | Agents       | Agent roster, activity, unread state, deep links |
| 5 | Search       | Query/facets/results/preview explorer |
| 6 | Reservations | Active/released file reservations, create/release workflows |
| 7 | Tool Metrics | Per-tool latency/error/call-count observability |
| 8 | SystemHealth | Probes, disk/memory, and circuit-breaker state |
| 9 | Timeline     | Events/Commits/Combined chronology + inspector |
| 10 | Projects    | Project inventory, stats, and routing helpers |
| 11 | Contacts    | Contact graph and policy management |
| 12 | Explorer    | Unified mailbox explorer with direction and ack filters |
| 13 | Analytics   | Anomaly feed with confidence and remediation links |

### 4.1 Representative Operator Workflows

1. Incident triage from Dashboard:
   `1` → inspect anomaly rail and event log → `Enter` on high-signal event to deep-link Timeline → `9` verify sequence and timestamps.
2. Ack backlog chase:
   `2` Messages with filter/sort + presets → locate `ack_required` high/urgent traffic → pivot to `3` Threads for context → acknowledge via MCP/CLI.
3. Reservation contention diagnosis:
   `6` Reservations to identify conflicting globs/holders → `4` Agents for ownership/activity recency → `11` Contacts if policy/linking blocks direct coordination.
4. Tool latency regression check:
   `7` Tool Metrics to identify slow/failing tools → `8` SystemHealth to check DB/circuit pressure → `13` Analytics for anomaly context → capture diagnostics bundle.
5. Attachment and archive forensics:
   `14` Attachments to locate suspect payloads/messages → `15` Archive Browser for canonical file history → export evidence.

### 4.2 Cross-Project Inbox Usage (Messages)

1. Jump to Messages (`2`) and press `g` to toggle Local vs Global inbox mode.
2. In Global mode, triage by urgency/ack requirements first; then pivot to Threads (`3`) for context.
3. Save high-value filter setups with `Ctrl+S`; restore with `Ctrl+L`.
4. Use `p/P` query presets for rapid rotation between All/Urgent/Ack-focused views.

### 4.3 Advanced Search With Scope Filters

1. Open Search (`5`) and press `/` to focus the query bar.
2. Press `f` to focus the facet rail.
3. Use `j/k` to move between facets and `Enter` to cycle values.
4. Critical facets: Scope (Global/Project/Product), Sort Order (Newest/Oldest/Relevance), Field Scope (Subject/Body/Both), Importance/Ack.
5. Press `r` to reset all facets to defaults when search gets over-constrained.

### 4.4 Archive Browsing in TUI

1. Jump to Archive Browser (`%` / screen 15).
2. Navigate tree with `j/k`; use `Enter` to expand directories or preview files.
3. Use `Tab` to switch between tree and preview panes.
4. Use `Ctrl+D/U` for preview paging and `/` for filename filtering.
5. Use this view for canonical Git-backed evidence when diagnosing message/archive drift.

### 4.5 Human Overseer Message Composition

Use the web overseer form when humans need to redirect active agents quickly:

1. Open `/mail/{project}/overseer/compose`.
2. Select explicit recipients, enter the intervention reason, and write subject/body
   (optionally set `thread_id`).
3. For multiple recipients, confirm the final recipient list before sending.
4. Submit to send a high-importance message as `HumanOverseer`.
5. Agents receive it through normal inbox resources/tools and can reply in-thread.

The overseer route rejects broadcast-style sends and unknown recipients. The
response and structured audit event include the `HumanOverseer` marker, reason,
recipient list, thread id, and contact-policy-bypass flag.

### 4.6 Agent Network Graph Interpretation (Contacts)

1. Open Contacts (`!` / screen 11) and press `n` for Graph mode.
2. In Graph mode, inspect node centrality (high message volume) and dense edge clusters (coordination hotspots).
3. Press `g` to toggle Mermaid panel for textual graph export/inspection.
4. Use this before large multi-agent swarms to identify overloaded communication paths.

## 5. Transport Modes

The server exposes identical tools and resources under two base paths:

| Mode | Base path | Use case                        |
|------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| MCP  | `/mcp/`   | Standard MCP protocol (default)  |
| API  | `/api/`   | Alternative REST-style routing   |

**Switch at runtime:** Press `m` or use the command palette action
"Toggle MCP/API mode". The server restarts its HTTP listener with the
new base path. Active connections are dropped and reconnect
automatically.

**Switch at startup:** `am serve-http --path api` or `HTTP_PATH=/api/`.

## 6. Configuration Reference

All configuration is via environment variables. The `Config::from_env()`
function reads them at startup. A cached singleton (`global_config()`)
is used in hot paths.

### Worker Thread Stacks

A stack overflow is **not recoverable** in Rust: the runtime prints
`fatal runtime error: stack overflow` and aborts the process. It cannot be
caught, and every other thread's in-flight work dies with it. Rust gives
spawned threads a 2 MiB stack by default while the main thread inherits the
process rlimit (usually 8 MiB), which is how GH#202 aborted the daemon — the
`am-archive-read` worker ran the archive reconstruction/salvage path on 2 MiB
at production scale.

Every worker thread this project spawns is therefore given an explicit 32 MiB
stack from a single shared policy, rather than sizing only the threads that
look deep. Thread stacks are reserved address space committed lazily per page,
so an untouched 32 MiB stack costs approximately zero resident memory; the
whole fleet of workers reserves well under a gigabyte of a 128 TiB address
space. Leaving these at their defaults is correct for essentially all
deployments.

| Variable                                     | Default | Description                          |
|----------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| `MCP_AGENT_MAIL_WORKER_STACK_MB`             | `32`    | Stack (MiB) for every spawned worker thread, clamped to 8..512. A value below the floor is clamped up rather than honored, so the GH#202 abort cannot be reintroduced by a stray small setting. |
| `MCP_AGENT_MAIL_READ_SNAPSHOT_STACK_MB`      | —       | Legacy alias for the above, honored so existing GH#202 workarounds keep working. Prefer the new name. |
| `MCP_AGENT_MAIL_READ_SNAPSHOT_EXACT_AUDIT_MS`| `1000`  | Interval between exact (content-hash) generation audits, capped at 30s |

`RUST_MIN_STACK` is also honored: the worker stack is the larger of the
configured value and `RUST_MIN_STACK`. `Builder::stack_size` normally overrides
`RUST_MIN_STACK` in std, so this is folded in deliberately — an operator who
already raised it as a GH#202 workaround keeps that headroom instead of being
silently lowered to the built-in default.

Note this bounds *deep* recursion, not *unbounded* recursion. A call chain that
recurses proportionally to mailbox or archive size would still exhaust any
fixed stack; that has to be fixed in the recursion itself.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Port already in use

**Symptom:** Startup probe fails with "Port 8765 is already in use"

**Fix:**
```bash
# Find the process using the port
ss -tlnp | grep 8765
# or
lsof -i :8765

# If it is already Agent Mail, reuse that server.
# Otherwise, start on a different port.
am serve-http --port 9000
```

### Database locked

**Symptom:** `database is locked` errors in logs or tool responses

**Causes:**
1. Another `mcp-agent-mail` process has the database open
2. Pool exhaustion under high load
3. Long-running transaction blocking WAL checkpointing

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check for other processes
pgrep -f mcp-agent-mail

# Increase pool size
DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=50 DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW=150 am serve-http

# Check for stuck WAL
sqlite3 "$DATABASE_URL" "PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE);"
```

### Authentication failures

**Symptom:** Tool calls return 401 Unauthorized

**Fix:**
1. Verify token is set: `echo $HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN`
2. Check env file: `cat ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/mcp-agent-mail/config.env` (or legacy `~/.mcp_agent_mail/.env`)
3. For local dev, use `--no-auth` or set `HTTP_ALLOW_LOCALHOST_UNAUTHENTICATED=true`

### SQLite corruption

**Symptom:** `PRAGMA integrity_check` fails at startup

**Fix:**
```bash
# Run integrity check manually
sqlite3 /path/to/storage.sqlite3 "PRAGMA integrity_check;"

# If corrupt, rebuild from archive (the archive is the source of truth):
# 1. Back up the corrupt database
cp storage.sqlite3 storage.sqlite3.corrupt

# 2. Quarantine the broken file (non-destructive)
mv storage.sqlite3 "storage.sqlite3.corrupt.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"

# 3. Restart — the server will create a fresh database
am serve-http
```

### No events appearing in Dashboard

**Symptom:** Dashboard shows no events or stale data

**Causes:**
1. Server not receiving requests (check port/path)
2. Poller not running (TUI disabled or crashed)
3. Event buffer overflow under extreme load

**Fix:**
1. Verify the server is reachable: `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/`
2. Switch to System Health screen (`8`) to check connection probes
3. Press `r` to force refresh

### Transport mode switch fails

**Symptom:** Pressing `m` shows toast but server doesn't respond on new path

**Fix:**
1. Check logs for bind errors
2. The old port/path is released and the new one is bound. If the new path
   is invalid, the server falls back to the previous path.
3. Restart with the desired path: `am serve-http --path api`

### High memory usage

**Symptom:** RSS exceeds warning thresholds (visible in System Health screen)

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check current RSS
grep VmRSS /proc/$(pgrep -f mcp-agent-mail)/status

# Reduce pool sizes
DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=10 DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW=20 am serve-http

# Reduce event buffer capacity (in-memory event ring)
# Check memory pressure on System Health screen (8)
```

### Capacity governor warnings

**Symptom:** `am robot health` shows the `backpressure` probe as `yellow` or
`red`, with a detail like `decision=defer`, `decision=downgrade`, or
`decision=shed`.

**Model:** The governor combines DB pool pressure, WBQ depth, commit-coalescer
depth, queue wait p95, disk pressure, and RSS pressure. Missing or stale
disk/RSS samples are ignored so the system falls back to the older static
queue/pool behavior instead of pinning itself in a stale overload state.

**Policy:** Coordination-critical mutations such as `send_message`,
reservations, acknowledgements, contacts writes, and build-slot writes remain
accepted. Low-priority read paths such as search, summarization, `whois`,
`list_contacts`, and product-bus reads are the only shedable class.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Inspect the decision and raw signals.
AM_INTERFACE_MODE=cli am robot health --format json

# Confirm queue and storage pressure.
AM_INTERFACE_MODE=cli am robot metrics --format json

# Enforce shedding only after confirming callers can tolerate retries.
BACKPRESSURE_SHEDDING_ENABLED=true am serve-http
```

Leave `BACKPRESSURE_SHEDDING_ENABLED=false` for shadow mode. In shadow mode the
probe still reports the admission recommendation, but dispatch does not reject
shedable reads.

### Adaptive archive commit coalescing

**Symptom:** Archive commits lag during bursts, or Git churn is too high when
disk pressure is elevated.

**Model:** The commit coalescer now computes a recommended flush window from
per-repo depth, global pending commit requests, disk pressure, and the operator
latency budget. By default this is shadow-only: workers record the recommended
target window, the effective window, batching ratio, and max archive lag while
continuing to use the static `AM_ARCHIVE_BATCH_MS` cadence.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Inspect queue health and storage latency.
AM_INTERFACE_MODE=cli am robot metrics --format json

# Tune the latency budget while staying in shadow mode.
AM_COALESCER_TARGET_ARCHIVE_LAG_MS=1000 am serve-http

# Enable adaptive worker cadence after confirming operators tolerate the lag.
AM_COALESCER_ADAPTIVE_FLUSH_ENABLED=true \
  AM_COALESCER_TARGET_ARCHIVE_LAG_MS=1000 \
  am serve-http
```

The adaptive window is clamped to 5-5000 ms. `flush_sync`, graceful shutdown,
and explicit flushes still bypass the timed window and drain queued work before
returning or timing out.

### Git index.lock contention

**Symptom:** `index.lock` errors in logs during high-throughput commits

The commit coalescer retries with jittered exponential backoff (up to 7
attempts) and removes stale locks older than 60 seconds as a last resort.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check for stale locks (adjust path to your STORAGE_ROOT)
find "${STORAGE_ROOT:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/mcp-agent-mail/git_mailbox_repo}" -name "index.lock" -ls

# If the owning process is dead, quarantine the stale lock:
SROOT="${STORAGE_ROOT:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/mcp-agent-mail/git_mailbox_repo}"
mv "$SROOT/projects/<slug>/.git/index.lock" \
   "$SROOT/projects/<slug>/.git/index.lock.stale"
```

### Disk space warnings

**Symptom:** Yellow/red disk indicators in System Health screen

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check disk usage (adjust path to your STORAGE_ROOT)
du -sh "${STORAGE_ROOT:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/mcp-agent-mail/git_mailbox_repo}/"

# Inventory proof artifacts before cleanup
am doctor artifacts --json | jq '{totals, disk, largest_roots, warnings}'

# Archive reviewed artifacts manually; am doctor artifacts never deletes
tar -C <parent> -czf /tmp/<root>.tgz <root>
mkdir -p <storage-root>/doctor/archive-quarantine/manual
mv <reviewed-stale-root> <storage-root>/doctor/archive-quarantine/manual/

# Adjust thresholds
DISK_SPACE_WARNING_MB=200 DISK_SPACE_CRITICAL_MB=50 am serve-http
```

`am doctor artifacts` is the safe retention governor for proof artifacts:
it reports repo test/perf/e2e roots, CLI failure artifacts, refactor ledgers,
doctor reports, forensic bundles, quarantine roots, recovery backups, and
per-project attachment roots. The command is read-only. It includes retention
classes, byte/file totals, the largest exact roots, disk pressure state, and
manual remediation guidance. Cleanup remains an operator action: archive or
quarantine reviewed evidence only after preserving anything needed for a
postmortem, regression proof, release gate, or user-facing support thread.

### Deployment Validation (`verify-live`)

Use native verify-live for operator checks and release gates:

```bash
# Create bundle artifact (local pre-flight input)
am share export -o /tmp/agent-mail-bundle --no-zip

# Verify deployed host against the local bundle
am share deploy verify-live https://example.github.io/agent-mail \
  --bundle /tmp/agent-mail-bundle \
  --json > /tmp/verify-live.json

# Fast triage view
jq '{verdict, summary, remote_checks: [.stages.remote.checks[] | {id, severity, passed, message}]}' /tmp/verify-live.json
```

Cloudflare Pages deployment path (native artifacts + verification):

```bash
# Generate deployment tooling files, including Cloudflare workflow + wrangler template
am share deploy tooling /tmp/agent-mail-bundle

# Expected Cloudflare artifacts
ls /tmp/agent-mail-bundle/.github/workflows/deploy-cf-pages.yml
ls /tmp/agent-mail-bundle/wrangler.toml.template

# Verify a Cloudflare Pages host against the same bundle
am share deploy verify-live https://<project>.pages.dev \
  --bundle /tmp/agent-mail-bundle \
  --json > /tmp/verify-live-cf.json
```

Interpretation:
- Exit `0`: pass, or warning-only in non-strict mode.
- Exit `1`: at least one error check failed, or warning-only with `--strict`.
- Stage-level details and per-check messages are in the JSON report.

Compatibility-only wrapper behavior:
- Generated `scripts/validate_deploy.sh` should be treated as compatibility fallback.
- Prefer native command path in docs/CI/runbooks: `am share deploy verify-live`.

### Troubleshooting Suite Map (Use Before Escalation)

Search V3-specific steady-state procedures live in:
`docs/RUNBOOK-search-v3-migration.md#steady-state-operations-post-cutover`.

| Symptom / Concern | Run This Suite | Expected Artifact Root |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| MCP/API mode drift or deny behavior mismatch | `am e2e run --project . dual_mode` | `tests/artifacts/dual_mode/<timestamp>/` |
| TUI startup/bootstrap/token-redaction regressions | `am e2e run --project . tui_startup` | `tests/artifacts/tui_startup/<timestamp>/` |
| Search V3 relevance/latency/resilience drift | `am e2e run --project . search_v3_stdio search_v3_http search_v3_resilience search_v3_load_concurrency` | `tests/artifacts/search_v3_*/<timestamp>/` |

For any failing suite, validate forensic bundle structure:

```bash
source scripts/e2e_lib.sh
e2e_validate_bundle_tree tests/artifacts
```

Compatibility fallback for native-regression emergencies:
`AM_E2E_FORCE_LEGACY=1 ./scripts/e2e_test.sh <suite>`

### Structured Diagnostics Pointers (Phase 5)

| Suite | Primary Diagnostics File |
|-------|---------------------------|
| `search_v3_stdio` | `tests/artifacts/search_v3_stdio/<timestamp>/search_v3/summaries/suite_summary.json` |
| `search_v3_http` | `tests/artifacts/search_v3_http/<timestamp>/search_v3/summaries/suite_summary.json` |

## 8. Diagnostics Collection

When reporting issues, collect the following:

```bash
# 1. Server version and build info
cargo run -p mcp-agent-mail -- --version

# 2. Configuration dump (sanitized — no tokens)
env | grep -E '^(HTTP_|DATABASE_|STORAGE_|TUI_|LOG_|DISK_|MEMORY_)' | sed 's/TOKEN=.*/TOKEN=***/'

# 3. Database health
sqlite3 /path/to/storage.sqlite3 "PRAGMA integrity_check; PRAGMA journal_mode; PRAGMA wal_checkpoint;"

# 4. Process stats
ps aux | grep mcp-agent-mail
cat /proc/$(pgrep -f mcp-agent-mail)/status | grep -E 'VmRSS|VmSize|Threads'

# 5. Disk usage (adjust path to your STORAGE_ROOT)
SROOT="${STORAGE_ROOT:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/mcp-agent-mail/git_mailbox_repo}"
du -sh "$SROOT/"
df -h "$SROOT/"

# 6. MCP resource snapshots (if server is running)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/ -H "Authorization: Bearer $HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"resources/read","params":{"uri":"resource://tooling/diagnostics"}}'

# 7. Recent logs
# If LOG_JSON_ENABLED=true, logs are structured and can be filtered with jq
```

### One-Command CI Artifact Retrieval + Unpack (Failing Run)

From the repository root, this command downloads the latest failed CI run
artifacts, unpacks them, and validates all discovered `bundle.json` files:

```bash
RUN_ID="$(gh run list --workflow ci.yml --status failure --limit 1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')" && \
OUT_DIR="/tmp/am-ci-artifacts-${RUN_ID}" && \
mkdir -p "${OUT_DIR}" && \
gh run download "${RUN_ID}" -D "${OUT_DIR}" && \
bash -lc 'source scripts/e2e_lib.sh; e2e_validate_bundle_tree "'"${OUT_DIR}"'"'
```

Manual equivalent (specific run ID):

```bash
RUN_ID=<run-id>
OUT_DIR="/tmp/am-ci-artifacts-${RUN_ID}"
gh run download "${RUN_ID}" -D "${OUT_DIR}"
source scripts/e2e_lib.sh
e2e_validate_bundle_tree "${OUT_DIR}"
```

### MCP Diagnostic Resources

These resources are available via MCP `resources/read`:

| URI                                 | Content                                    |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `resource://tooling/diagnostics`    | Full diagnostic report (health, metrics)   |
| `resource://tooling/metrics`        | Per-tool call counts and latencies         |
| `resource://tooling/locks`          | Active lock state and contention info      |
| `resource://tooling/directory`      | Available tools by cluster                 |
| `resource://projects`               | All registered projects                    |
| `resource://agents/{slug}`          | Agents for a project                       |
| `resource://file_reservations/{slug}` | Active file reservations                 |

## 9. Themes

Five built-in themes are available, cycled with `Shift+T`:

1. **Cyberpunk Aurora** — Neon accents on dark background
2. **Darcula** — IntelliJ-style dark theme
3. **Lumen Light** — Light theme for bright environments
4. **Nordic Frost** — Cool blue tones
5. **High Contrast** — Maximum readability (also via `TUI_HIGH_CONTRAST=true`)

Theme selection is not persisted across restarts. Set
`CONSOLE_THEME=<name>` for a default preference.

## 10. Launch Safety Checklist

Run this before declaring a rollout candidate:

1. Security/auth:
   confirm expected auth mode (`HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN` configured unless explicitly local-only), and verify unauthorized requests are denied when auth is on.
2. Accessibility:
   verify `TUI_HIGH_CONTRAST=true` readability and key workflows (`Dashboard`, `Messages`, `Reservations`, `SystemHealth`) with keyboard-only navigation.
3. Reliability:
   run critical suites from Section 7 and keep artifact bundles for review.
4. Parity:
   verify no regressions on active parity tracks (`mail_ui`, `dual_mode`, export/share suites).
5. Rollback readiness:
   confirm fallback launch command and prior known-good commit are recorded in incident notes before go/no-go.

## 11. Deterministic Showcase Demo

Use this when you need a reproducible handoff bundle that demonstrates startup,
search/explorer, analytics/widgets, security/redaction, macro workflows/playback,
and cross-terminal compatibility in one run.

### Run

```bash
# Native standard suite path:
am e2e run --project . tui_startup

# Showcase compatibility path (includes --showcase staging extras):
bash scripts/e2e_tui_startup.sh --showcase
```

Optional deterministic overrides:

```bash
AM_TUI_SHOWCASE_SEED=20260211 \
AM_TUI_SHOWCASE_TIMESTAMP=20260211_120000 \
bash scripts/e2e_tui_startup.sh --showcase
```

### Stage Contract (Reset/Setup/Teardown Included)

1. Reset/setup captures deterministic env and creates `tests/artifacts/tui_showcase/<timestamp>/showcase/`.
2. Suite stages run and validate expected artifacts:
   `tui_startup`, `search_cockpit`, `tui_interactions`, `security_privacy`,
   `macros`, `tui_compat_matrix`.
3. Macro playback forensics stage runs:
   `rch exec -- cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-server operator_macro_record_save_load_replay_forensics -- --nocapture`.
4. Teardown writes handoff metadata without deleting artifacts.

### Handoff Artifacts

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Showcase manifest | `tests/artifacts/tui_showcase/<timestamp>/showcase/manifest.json` |
| Stage index (suite + rc + log) | `tests/artifacts/tui_showcase/<timestamp>/showcase/index.tsv` |
| Deterministic replay command | `tests/artifacts/tui_showcase/<timestamp>/showcase/repro_command.txt` |
| Explorer/analytics/widgets trace | `tests/artifacts/tui_interactions/<timestamp>/trace/analytics_widgets_timeline.tsv` |
| Security/redaction evidence | `tests/artifacts/security_privacy/<timestamp>/case_06_hostile_md.txt`, `tests/artifacts/security_privacy/<timestamp>/case_09_secret_body.txt` |
| Cross-terminal profile matrix | `tests/artifacts/tui_compat_matrix/<timestamp>/profiles/tmux_screen_resize_matrix/layout_trace.tsv` |
| Macro playback forensic report | `tests/artifacts/tui/macro_replay/*_record_save_load_replay/report.json` |

### Demo Failure Recovery Appendix

| Failure | Recovery Command |
|---------|------------------|
| Missing `pyte` for PTY render emulation | `python3 -m pip install --user pyte` |
| Missing shell tools (`expect`, `tmux`, `script`) | Install required packages, then re-run showcase command. |
| A specific suite fails and you need focused rerun | `AM_TUI_SHOWCASE_SUITES=tui_interactions bash scripts/e2e_tui_startup.sh --showcase` |
| Macro playback forensic step fails | `rch exec -- cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-server operator_macro_record_save_load_replay_forensics -- --nocapture` |
| `tui_wasm` records `RCH_REMOTE_DEP_MISMATCH` skips | `rch workers probe --all && rch status && rch queue` then rerun `am e2e run --project . tui_wasm` |
| Artifact path mismatch (wrong timestamp) | `ls -1 tests/artifacts/tui_showcase/ | tail -n 5` then open matching `showcase/index.tsv` |

## 12. Graceful Shutdown

Press `q` to initiate shutdown. The server:

1. Stops accepting new connections
2. Flushes the commit coalescer queue (waits up to 30 seconds)
3. Releases all file reservations held by this process
4. Closes the database pool
5. Exits

For immediate termination, send `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C).

## 13. Health Levels

The System Health screen shows overall health as Green/Yellow/Red:

| Level  | Meaning                              | Action                       |
|--------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Green  | All systems operational              | None needed                  |
| Yellow | Warning thresholds exceeded          | Monitor closely              |
| Red    | Critical condition detected          | Investigate and remediate    |

At Red level, the server may shed non-essential tools to protect core
operations. Check the System Health screen for specifics.

## 14. Common Operations

### Restart without data loss
```bash
# The commit coalescer flushes on shutdown
# Just stop and start again
q  # or Ctrl+C
am serve-http
```

### Change database location
```bash
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///path/to/new.sqlite3 am serve-http
```

The three-slash form names an absolute path (`sqlite:///var/lib/am/x.sqlite3` is `/var/lib/am/x.sqlite3`, the same as `sqlite:////var/lib/am/x.sqlite3`). A path relative to the working directory must be spelled that way: `sqlite:///./x.sqlite3` or `sqlite://x.sqlite3`. A missing relative target is never replaced by an absolute file that happens to share the suffix.

### Run in production mode
```bash
APP_ENVIRONMENT=production \
  LOG_LEVEL=warn \
  LOG_JSON_ENABLED=true \
  HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  mcp-agent-mail serve --no-tui
```

### Enable rate limiting
```bash
HTTP_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true \
  HTTP_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=1000 \
  HTTP_RATE_LIMIT_TOOLS_PER_MINUTE=500 \
  am serve-http
```

### Enable periodic integrity checks
```bash
INTEGRITY_CHECK_ON_STARTUP=true \
  INTEGRITY_CHECK_INTERVAL_HOURS=12 \
  am serve-http
```

## Emergency: Roll Back Archive Batch-Write Optimization

Use this when the storage-native batch archive write path regresses edge cases in
production: missing canonical files, archive/DB parity drift after bursts,
unexpected commit-coalescer behavior, or durability concerns after crashes.

### Filesystem Guidance for Archive Perf and Durability

The archive batch path is portable across supported filesystems, but `fsync` cost
and durability semantics are not identical. Use the cross-filesystem probe
before concluding that a regression is universal:

```bash
scripts/bench_archive_fsync_matrix.sh --filesystem ext4-ordered
scripts/bench_archive_fsync_matrix.sh --filesystem btrfs
```

Use these rules when choosing or diagnosing a host filesystem:

- **Prefer ext4 (`data=ordered`) or xfs for lowest archive write latency.**
  These are the reference Linux targets for the `<250ms` batch-100 `p95`
  budget.
- **ext4 (`data=journal`) is supported when stronger journal guarantees matter
  more than latency.** Expect slower burst writes and compare against the
  journal-specific budget rather than the ordered-mode baseline.
- **btrfs is supported but slower.** CoW + metadata updates amplify the batch
  path, so the CI gate allows up to `<500ms` batch-100 `p95` on btrfs. If only
  btrfs regresses, check snapshot churn, compression settings, and other
  metadata-heavy workload interference before rolling back a global archive
  change.
- **APFS is supported with different semantics.** Treat the macOS probe as a
  barrier-style durability signal, not a byte-for-byte match for Linux
  `fdatasync` behavior. Use APFS results to catch macOS-specific regressions,
  not to rewrite Linux budgets.
- **tmpfs is a negative control only.** Use it to separate logic/allocator
  regressions from disk regressions. Never treat tmpfs success as durable
  storage evidence.

Known quirks:

- ext4/xfs typically fail only when the archive path truly regresses.
- btrfs is the most sensitive to metadata churn and background snapshotting.
- APFS can look healthy on latency while still having different flush/barrier
  semantics than Linux; keep manual macOS spot-checks in the release checklist.

If the cross-filesystem matrix shows a regression on only one filesystem, keep
the incident scoped to that filesystem row in `benches/BUDGETS.md` first. If
multiple filesystems fail, treat it as a real archive-path regression and use
the rollback procedure below.

### Current reality

- The archive perf fix shipped in commit `99bc2663` (`fix(archive): batch 100 p95=238ms under budget (br-8qdh0.4)`).
- There is **no** `ARCHIVE_WRITE_MODE=fast|legacy|auto` runtime switch in the
  current codebase.
- Rollback therefore means **reverting the archive perf change and redeploying**
  a build that restores the pre-fix per-message write path.

### Trigger signals

Treat any of these as rollback candidates:

- `am doctor check` reports archive/DB parity drift immediately after a burst write window.
- Operators observe messages acknowledged in the UI but missing from the Git archive.
- `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_batch_*` remain healthy, but real traffic shows
  corruption, crash-recovery drift, or commit-coalescer edge cases that benches
  did not model.
- A crash or forced restart during a burst leaves archive state inconsistent and
  `am doctor repair --dry-run` proposes unexpected message reconstruction.

### Immediate containment

1. Stop promoting new builds that include the archive perf fix.
2. Capture operator evidence before mutation:
```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
am doctor check
am doctor repair --dry-run
```
3. Preserve the active forensic inputs:
   - latest `tests/artifacts/perf/archive_batch_*` artifacts
   - any `am doctor` warning report paths
   - the project slug(s) showing parity drift

### Rollback procedure

1. Move to `main` and fast-forward to the deployed revision:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only
```
2. Revert the archive perf change that introduced the batch path:
```bash
git revert --no-edit 99bc2663
```
3. Rebuild and redeploy the reverted revision.
   Use `rch` for the heavy compile path:
```bash
rch exec -- cargo check -p mcp-agent-mail --bench benchmarks
rch exec -- cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-storage
```
4. Restart the service so writes return to the legacy per-message path:
```bash
q  # or Ctrl+C if running in the foreground
am serve-http
```

### Post-rollback verification

Run the operator checks in this order:

```bash
am doctor check
am doctor repair --dry-run
```

- If `am doctor repair --dry-run` reports only safe hygiene, apply it:
```bash
am doctor repair --yes
```
- If parity still favors the Git archive or SQLite trust is in doubt, escalate to
  archive-first rebuild instead of forcing more in-place writes:
```bash
am doctor reconstruct --dry-run
```

### Re-enable the stress guard before re-promotion

Before allowing a new archive perf candidate back into rollout, rerun the
storage stress and batch benchmark guardrails on the reverted-or-fixed branch:

```bash
rch exec -- cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-storage --test stress_pipeline -- --nocapture
MCP_AGENT_MAIL_ARCHIVE_PROFILE=1 \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p mcp-agent-mail --bench benchmarks -- archive_write_batch
```

Expected result:

- storage stress passes without archive/DB divergence
- warm `batch-100` remains within the documented budget envelope in
  `benches/BUDGETS.md`
- no new `am doctor` parity or integrity warnings after restart

### Incident follow-up

After rollback:

1. File or update the incident bead with the trigger symptom, affected project
   slugs, and whether `repair` or `reconstruct` was required.
2. Record the exact reverted commit (`99bc2663`) and the rollback timestamp.
3. Attach the `archive_batch_*` perf artifacts and any `doctor` warning bundle
   paths so the next fix can distinguish a real correctness regression from a
   benchmark-only signal.

### Notes

- Keep follow-up documentation-only commits such as `5912d807`
  (`docs(perf): refresh archive baseline after under-budget fix`) unless you
  specifically need the release branch to present pre-fix benchmark narratives.
- Do not invent a runtime flag during an incident. If a future release adds an
  explicit archive write mode toggle, update this section to prefer the config
  flip over a git revert.

---

## Emergency: Disable ATC Learning

If ATC learning is causing production issues (latency spikes, DB errors, privacy concerns):

### Option A — ENV override (fastest, requires restart)

```bash
ATC_LEARNING_DISABLED=1 am serve-http
```

This overrides `AM_ATC_WRITE_MODE` regardless of its value. All `atc_note_*` calls
become immediate no-ops with zero compute.

### Option B — Kill-switch file (no restart, effective within one ATC tick)

```bash
# Activate — create sentinel file in the storage root
echo "latency spike incident 2026-04-18" > ~/.mcp_agent_mail_git_mailbox_repo/.atc_kill_switch

# Deactivate — remove the file to resume
rm ~/.mcp_agent_mail_git_mailbox_repo/.atc_kill_switch
```

The ATC operator loop checks for this file every tick (~5 seconds). When present,
`atc_write_mode()` returns `Off` regardless of `AM_ATC_WRITE_MODE`.

### Verify

```bash
am robot atc --summary-only --toon | grep kill_switch
```

### Behavior while disabled

- All `atc_note_*` return immediately (no engine lock, no compute, no log)
- State transitions are logged at INFO level when the kill switch activates or deactivates
- When re-enabled, the system resumes insertion without backfilling missed events (gaps are expected and documented in the ledger)

### Related env vars

The complete `AM_ATC_*` surface is registered in `am flags` — run `am config atc`
(or `am flags list --subsystem atc`) for effective values and their sources, and
`am flags explain <VAR>` for accepted values. Defaults and meanings are tabulated
in the README ("Air Traffic Control (ATC) configuration").

| Variable | Values | Default | Purpose |

### ATC observability signals

When ATC learning is enabled, watch these signals together:

- Tracing events: `atc.insert_experience`, `atc.resolve_experience`, `atc.sweep.resolution_window`, `atc.decision`, `atc.shadow.would_insert`, `atc.safe_mode.enter`, `atc.safe_mode.exit`, `atc.kill_switch.change`
- Metrics: experience writes/resolutions, open-experience counts by stratum, resolution-sweep latency, safe-mode transitions, shadow events, derivation errors, kill-switch gauge
- TUI surface: the SystemHealth dashboard includes an `ATC Health` widget summarizing write volume, unresolved strata, sweep p95, kill-switch state, and safe-mode state

Use [`docs/ATC_ALERTS_EXAMPLE.yaml`](ATC_ALERTS_EXAMPLE.yaml) as the baseline alert contract for Prometheus-compatible rules. The file is intentionally small and focuses on operator actionability rather than exhaustive coverage.

### ATC historical backfill policy

ATC learns only from events observed going forward — there is no backfill of prior messaging history from the Git archive. The archive contains Markdown artifacts and commit metadata, but these lack the feature-vector context (posterior distributions, calibration state, safe-mode flags, timing signals) that live-captured experiences carry, so any reconstructed rows would be systematically lower quality and could bias the learning pipeline. This is an intentional design decision (Option A from br-bn0vb.23). If a future release adds an optional `am atc ingest-archive` tool for exploratory backfill, ingested rows will be tagged `backfilled=true` so policies can down-weight or exclude them.
