# Recovery Runbook

## Symptoms
- SQLite corruption detected (`PRAGMA integrity_check` fails).
- Search/index inconsistencies vs archive.
- Missing records in SQLite after archive write.

## Steps
1. Acquire project archive lock (`projects/<slug>/.archive.lock`).
2. Validate archive as source of truth (ensure files exist, git repo healthy).
3. Rebuild SQLite index from archive contents.
4. Update version markers (archive commit hash + db schema version).
5. Verify counts and sample hashes.
6. Release lock.

## Commands (Planned)
- `reindex` (archive -> SQLite)
- `integrity-check` (SQLite + archive)
- `doctor repair` (wraps the above with backups)

## Reconstruct/Promotion Refusal Loop (GH#208)

**Symptoms**: `serve-http` restarts forever under a supervisor; every
iteration logs `Startup detected mailbox database issues; reconstructing
from archive`, followed by `reconstruction succeeded but final database
promotion failed: recovery candidate ... would lose stable coordination
keys ... refusing promotion`, exit 1.

**Cause (fixed after v0.3.24)**: the promotion guard compared
full-payload fingerprints, so state the archive legitimately cannot
reproduce — registration tokens, per-recipient read/ack timestamps,
contact/reservation lifecycle fields, normalized message serialization —
counted as "loss" even when every coordination identity survived. One
drifted message additionally cascaded into all of its recipient rows.
Since the reconstruct trigger wanted `db ⊇ archive` while the guard
wanted `candidate ⊇ db` per payload byte, a mailbox drifted in both
directions could satisfy neither and the loop never terminated.

**Current behavior**: the guard refuses only on *identity* loss
(project slug + agent name; message stable key of
project/sender/thread/subject/created_ts; recipient identity chained to
the parent's identity digest; reservation lease key; contact
endpoints). Volatile payload drift is reported as informational counts
in the refusal text and the recovery receipt (`identity_*` fields), and
a candidate that is an identity superset promotes. Index-only
corruption (`wrong # of entries in index ...` from `integrity_check`)
is additionally repaired in place with `REINDEX` before any
reconstruction is attempted — including when `quick_check` alone looks
clean.

**On affected older versions (v0.3.22–v0.3.24)**:

```bash
systemctl --user stop agent-mail        # or your supervisor's stop
sqlite3 storage.sqlite3 "REINDEX;"      # heals index-only corruption losslessly
sqlite3 storage.sqlite3 "PRAGMA integrity_check;"   # expect: ok
systemctl --user start agent-mail
```

If the loop persists because live and archive genuinely diverged,
upgrade to a fixed build rather than hand-merging the candidate.

## Git 2.51.0 Index Race

**Symptoms** (any of):

- kernel log segfault lines with `ip 00000000001db250 ... error 4 in git[...]`
- `fatal: bad object HEAD` after an agent session
- orphan `refs/stash` whose target object is missing (ref points at a
  SHA that `git cat-file` can't find)
- `ahead=-1 behind=-1` from `ru status` or similar tooling
- repos that re-corrupt within minutes after a fresh `git clone`

### Diagnose

Check for the signature in kernel log:

```bash
journalctl -k --since '24 hours ago' \
  | awk '/segfault/ && /git\[/' \
  | head -20
```

A stream of `ip 00000000001db250 ... error 4` lines confirms this is
the 2.51.0 bug. (Disassemble `/usr/bin/git` around `0x1db240` if you
want to see the faulting `testb $0x1,0x52(%r12)` — it's reading
`cache_entry::ce_flags` after the backing mmap was invalidated.)

Run `am doctor check` for a structured report (once A2 ships this):

```bash
am doctor check --format json | jq '.findings[] | select(.code == "GIT_2_51_0_INDEX_RACE")'
```

### Remediate (in order)

1. **Point mcp-agent-mail at a safe git**
   (fastest mitigation; does NOT affect the rest of your system):

   ```bash
   # Identify a safe git binary somewhere on the system
   ls /usr/local/git-2.50*/bin/git 2>/dev/null
   ls /opt/git-2.50*/bin/git 2>/dev/null

   # Point mcp-agent-mail at it
   export AM_GIT_BINARY=/usr/local/git-2.50.2/bin/git
   # Persist in your shell profile; add to systemd unit if running as service.
   ```

2. **Upgrade or downgrade the system git**
   (preferred long-term — also protects unwrapped git calls like
   your IDE's `git commit`):

   - Ubuntu 25.10 (questing ships 2.51.0): wait for 2.51.1 in
     `questing-updates`, or downgrade via `apt install
     git=<older-version>`.
   - macOS Homebrew: `brew install git@2.50` (if the formula exists)
     or pin via `brew extract git 2.50.2` into a tap.
   - Source: build git 2.50.x from tag, install to `/usr/local/git-2.50/`.

3. **Clean up damaged refs** on repos that were hit before the fix:

   ```bash
   # Dry-run (default): see what would be pruned
   am doctor fix-orphan-refs --all --dry-run --format json

   # Review, then apply
   am doctor fix-orphan-refs --all --apply
   ```

   Backups land under `<STORAGE_ROOT>/backups/refs/<project_slug>/`
   (last 10 kept) so you can restore manually if we over-pruned.

### Verify

After applying remediation:

```bash
# Run a synthetic stress loop that exercises the exact race.
# Requires the git-251-racer fixture (bead H1).
cargo test -p mcp-agent-mail-storage --test it libgit2_index_race_immunity:: \
  -- --nocapture
# Opt in via AM_C8_RUN=1; gated because it deliberately triggers
# CLI git segfaults on 2.51.0 boxes.

# Kernel log should show zero new segfaults during the next session:
journalctl -k --since '10 minutes ago' | awk '/segfault/ && /git\[/' | wc -l
# Expected: 0 when AM_GIT_BINARY is pointing at a safe git.
```
