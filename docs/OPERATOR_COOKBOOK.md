# MCP Agent Mail Operator Cookbook

Canonical copy-paste recipes for common operator workflows. Use this when you
need a known-good command sequence quickly; use
[`docs/OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md`](OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md) for deeper operational
background and TUI-specific troubleshooting.

> Replace placeholders such as `/abs/path/project`, `BlueLake`, `THREAD_ID`,
> `MESSAGE_ID`, and `age1...` before running anything.
>
> Recipes marked "read-only" inspect state. Recipes marked "stateful" write
> config, register agents, reserve files, send mail, or export bundles.
>
> Use targeted messaging only. `am mail send` requires explicit `--to`
> recipients; broadcast messaging is intentionally unsupported.

## 1. Bootstrap a local checkout and inspect setup [read-only]

**Goal:** See what `am setup` would configure before writing any local config.

```bash
cd /abs/path/project
am setup run --dry-run --yes --project-dir "$PWD" --format toon
am setup status --format toon
am setup status --format json
```

**Expected output:** A dry-run summary showing which config files would be
written or skipped, followed by a status report for the detected shell/editor
integration. Status output includes `primary_drift_reason`, `risk`, current and
expected server entries, and a remediation command. Tokens are redacted.

**Troubleshooting:** If the detected host, port, or path are wrong for this
checkout, rerun with `--host`, `--port`, or `--path`. For bearer-header drift,
provide the expected token with `--token` or through `HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN` /
`config.env`. When the dry run looks correct, apply the exact same target with
an explicit fix command:

```bash
am setup run --dry-run --project-dir "$PWD" --format toon
am setup run --yes --project-dir "$PWD" --format toon
```

## 2. Start a local HTTP server on a custom port [stateful]

**Goal:** Bring up a local MCP HTTP server quickly for manual testing.

Terminal A:

```bash
am serve-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000 --no-auth --no-tui
```

Terminal B:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:9000/health
```

**Expected output:** Terminal A stays attached to the server process. Terminal B
returns a health payload or status response proving the server bound to the
requested port.

CLI mail, inbox, agent, contact and reservation commands discover a custom
port when the same mailbox has one exclusive daemon owner and its recorded
listener hint still matches the operating system's listener PID. This needs
the same temporary directory and readable process/listener information.
Dead or ambiguous listeners are not selected. Explicit `AGENT_MAIL_URL`,
`HTTP_HOST` or `HTTP_PORT` settings take precedence over discovery. If that
explicit endpoint fails, the ownership refusal names the verified listener
and an `AGENT_MAIL_URL` override you can use to reach it.

To select the endpoint explicitly across repositories, export
`AGENT_MAIL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9000/mcp/` in your shell, or set `HTTP_PORT`
in the user configuration file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mcp-agent-mail/config.env`).
`am config set-port` updates the working-directory `.env`; it does not export
a variable into other shells. Process variables override user configuration,
which overrides the working-directory `.env`.

**Troubleshooting:** If the port is already in use, choose another `--port`
instead of killing the existing server. If you expect auth to be enabled, drop
`--no-auth` and make sure `HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN` resolves from your env file.

## 3. Register a named operator agent [stateful]

**Goal:** Create or refresh an explicit agent identity for a project.

```bash
PROJECT=/abs/path/project
AGENT=BlueLake

am agents register \
  --project "$PROJECT" \
  --program codex-cli \
  --model gpt-5 \
  --name "$AGENT" \
  --task "Operator sweep" \
  --format toon

am agents show --project "$PROJECT" "$AGENT" --format toon
```

**Expected output:** The register call returns the agent profile that was
created or refreshed. The follow-up show command prints the current stored
metadata for that exact agent name.

**Troubleshooting:** If the name is rejected, pick a valid adjective+noun name
or omit `--name` and let the CLI generate one. If the project key is wrong, the
agent will be registered in the wrong archive namespace.

## 4. Triage urgent inbox items and ack backlog [read-only]

**Goal:** See what needs attention first for one operator.

```bash
PROJECT=/abs/path/project
AGENT=BlueLake

am robot status --project "$PROJECT" --agent "$AGENT" --format toon
am robot inbox --project "$PROJECT" --agent "$AGENT" --urgent --format md
am robot inbox --project "$PROJECT" --agent "$AGENT" --ack-overdue --format toon
```

**Expected output:** A compact status summary, then a human-readable urgent
inbox view, then a focused list of ack-overdue items.

**Troubleshooting:** If the inbox comes back empty unexpectedly, confirm the
agent name spelling with `am agents list --project "$PROJECT"`. If the mailbox
is busy, wait for the current long-running operation to finish and retry.

## 5. Inspect a bead thread and a specific message [read-only]

**Goal:** Jump from a bead ID to the matching thread and then to one message.

```bash
PROJECT=/abs/path/project
AGENT=BlueLake
THREAD_ID=br-o217s.12
MESSAGE_ID=14

am robot search "$THREAD_ID" --project "$PROJECT" --agent "$AGENT" --format toon
am robot thread "$THREAD_ID" --project "$PROJECT" --agent "$AGENT" --format md
am robot message "$MESSAGE_ID" --project "$PROJECT" --agent "$AGENT" --format md
```

**Expected output:** Search results that confirm the thread exists, a rendered
thread transcript, and then a deep view of the selected message.

**Troubleshooting:** If `MESSAGE_ID` is wrong, rerun the thread view first and
pick a valid message ID from the recent messages. If the bead has no thread yet,
search by subject text instead of the bead ID.

## 6. Review one agent's last 24 hours [read-only]

**Goal:** Pull a compact recent activity review without guessing timestamp
syntax.

```bash
PROJECT=/abs/path/project
AGENT=BlueLake
SINCE="$(python3 - <<'PY'
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
print((datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(hours=24)).isoformat(timespec='seconds').replace('+00:00', 'Z'))
PY
)"

am robot timeline --project "$PROJECT" --agent "$AGENT" --since "$SINCE" --format md
am robot analytics --project "$PROJECT" --agent "$AGENT" --format toon
```

**Expected output:** A timeline covering the last 24 hours and an analytics
summary highlighting anomalies or remediation hints, if any.

**Troubleshooting:** `--since` expects an ISO-8601 timestamp, not shorthand such
as `24h`. If the timeline is too noisy, add `--kind` or `--source` filters.

## 7. See what work is ready before assigning agents [read-only]

**Goal:** Check the bead queue without leaving the CLI.

```bash
cd /abs/path/project
am beads status --format toon
am beads ready --limit 10 --format toon
am beads show br-o217s.12 --format toon
```

**Expected output:** A project status summary, then the current ready queue, and
then a detailed view of one candidate bead.

**Troubleshooting:** If the bead is not ready, inspect its blockers in the show
output before assigning it. For graph-level prioritization, use `bv
--robot-triage` instead of the interactive `bv` TUI.

## 8. Check reservation contention before editing [read-only]

**Goal:** See who already holds the files you want to touch.

```bash
PROJECT=/abs/path/project

am robot reservations --project "$PROJECT" --all --conflicts --format toon
am file_reservations conflicts "$PROJECT" README.md AGENTS.md
am file_reservations active "$PROJECT" --limit 20
```

**Expected output:** A robot-formatted conflict summary, a direct conflict check
for the named paths, and a broader list of active reservations in the project.

**Troubleshooting:** If you see a conflict, wait for the TTL to expire or
coordinate in-thread with the holder before editing. Do not work around the
reservation by touching the file anyway.

## 9. Release a crashed agent's reservations [stateful]

**Goal:** Clean up stale reservations after confirming an agent is no longer
active.

```bash
PROJECT=/abs/path/project
AGENT=BlueLake

am agents show --project "$PROJECT" "$AGENT" --format toon
am file_reservations active "$PROJECT"
am file_reservations release "$PROJECT" "$AGENT"
```

**Expected output:** The agent profile confirms who owns the reservations, the
active list shows what is currently leased, and the release command drops that
agent's active reservations.

**Troubleshooting:** Make sure the agent is actually idle before releasing its
leases. If you only want a subset, use `am file_reservations release "$PROJECT"
"$AGENT" --paths <path>`.

## 10. Send a targeted urgent message that requires acknowledgement [stateful]

**Goal:** Notify one agent about a blocking condition without spamming everyone
else.

```bash
PROJECT=/abs/path/project
FROM=BrownDove
TO=BlueLake
THREAD_ID=br-o217s.12

am mail send \
  --project "$PROJECT" \
  --from "$FROM" \
  --to "$TO" \
  --subject "[${THREAD_ID}] Action required" \
  --body "Please stop new edits and reply in-thread." \
  --thread-id "$THREAD_ID" \
  --topic "release.blocker" \
  --importance urgent \
  --ack-required \
  --format toon
```

**Expected output:** A delivery summary showing the message was queued for the
explicit recipient and attached to the requested thread.

`--topic` is optional. Use it when several threads belong to one stable work
stream: topics are case-insensitive, 1-64 safe ASCII characters, and replies
inherit the original topic. Use `--thread-id` for conversation identity and
`--topic` for cross-thread grouping; they are deliberately separate fields.

**Sender token (proving identity):** `am mail send` accepts a per-agent
`sender_token`. If `--from` was registered with `am agents register` or
`am macros start-session`, the token is persisted locally and reused
automatically — no extra flags needed. To supply it explicitly without echoing
the raw secret into shell history, prefer one of:

```bash
# From a file (contents trimmed):
am mail send ... --sender-token-file ~/.config/mcp-agent-mail/sender.token

# From the environment (not visible in `ps`/history):
AGENT_MAIL_SENDER_TOKEN="$(cat ~/.config/mcp-agent-mail/sender.token)" \
  am mail send ...
```

Resolution precedence: `--sender-token` (discouraged — visible in the process
list) > `--sender-token-file` > `AGENT_MAIL_SENDER_TOKEN` > persisted identity.

**Troubleshooting:** If the recipient is unknown, confirm the exact agent name
with `am agents list --project "$PROJECT"`. Do not look for a broadcast flag;
targeted delivery is the only supported path.

## 11. Export a mailbox bundle for a collaborator [stateful]

**Goal:** Produce a share bundle, preview it first, then export an encrypted
archive.

```bash
PROJECT=/abs/path/project
OUT=~/mailbox-share.zip
AGE_RECIPIENT=age1example...

am share export --output "$OUT" --project "$PROJECT" --dry-run
am share export --output "$OUT" --project "$PROJECT" --zip --age-recipient "$AGE_RECIPIENT"
am share verify "$OUT"
```

**Expected output:** The dry run summarizes what would be exported, the real
export writes the bundle to `OUT`, and verify confirms the resulting archive is
well-formed.

**Troubleshooting:** If you need a different scrub profile or chunking behavior,
add the relevant `am share export` flags explicitly. Use a real Age recipient
before dropping `--dry-run`.

## 12. Dry-run a legacy Python import or upgrade [stateful]

**Goal:** Inspect legacy state before performing any migration.

```bash
am legacy detect
am legacy status --format toon
am legacy import --auto --search-root "$HOME" --dry-run --format toon
am upgrade --search-root "$HOME" --dry-run --format toon
```

**Expected output:** Detection/status output describing legacy installations,
followed by dry-run plans for import and upgrade actions.

**Troubleshooting:** Narrow `--search-root` if the scan is too broad or too
slow. Keep the first pass as a dry run so you can review the detected paths
before changing anything.

## 13. Run doctor checks and inspect backups [read-only]

**Goal:** Collect health diagnostics before attempting manual repairs.

```bash
PROJECT=/abs/path/project

am doctor check "$PROJECT" --format toon
am doctor backups --format toon

# Reliability diagnostics (all read-only; run before any mutating repair):
am doctor health --format json        # one-line multi-verdict health rollup
am doctor locks --json                # owner intelligence: who holds the mailbox (live/wedged/stale)
am doctor drain                       # is it safe_to_mutate right now? (no live owner)
am doctor mcp-selftest --format json  # live MCP round-trip self-test
am doctor reclaim --dry-run           # preview consolidation of stale .doctor run debris
am doctor support-bundle --json       # sanitized incident bundle for maintainer triage (no raw DB/bodies)
```

**Expected output:** `doctor check` reports archive or database problems, and
`doctor backups` lists any available backup snapshots or recovery artifacts.
`doctor locks` / `doctor drain` tell you whether a live `am` still owns the
mailbox — `repair` and `reconstruct` refuse while a live owner is present, so
drain it via your supervisor first (never kill `am` directly).

**Troubleshooting:** If the mailbox lock is busy, wait for the current archive
operation to finish and retry. Run repair commands only after reading the doctor
output; diagnosis should come before mutation.

## 14. Plan archive pack maintenance [read-only]

**Goal:** Measure mailbox archive bloat without changing the Git archive.

```bash
am doctor pack-archive --plan
am doctor pack-archive --plan --json
git -C "$STORAGE_ROOT" count-objects -vH
```

**Expected output:** The planner reports global archive size, per-project
archive sizes, loose-object and packfile counts, pack ages, top artifact
categories, threshold verdicts, and exact safe follow-up commands.

**Safety:** The planner is read-only. It never runs `git maintenance`, never
prunes objects, and never deletes user data. If the verdict recommends action,
preserve the JSON output as evidence before running the stateful command:

```bash
am doctor pack-archive --json
```

`pack-archive` uses Git's loose-object and incremental-repack maintenance. That
can rewrite packfiles and temporarily increase disk usage while Git builds new
packs, but it does not prune live archive data. Do not run lower-level cleanup
commands unless a human has separately approved the exact command and risk.

## 15. Capture a quick benchmark baseline [read-only]

**Goal:** Get a fast performance snapshot before or after a change.

```bash
cd /abs/path/project
am bench --list
am bench --quick
am bench --quick --save-baseline /tmp/am-bench-baseline.json
```

**Expected output:** The available benchmark set, a quick benchmark run, and a
saved baseline file you can compare later.

**Troubleshooting:** If you only care about a subset, rerun with `--filter`.
For release-signoff performance work, capture the baseline on a machine that is
not already saturated by other agent builds.
