# RUNBOOK: Search V3 Migration Playbook

> Historical note (2026-04-18): This runbook describes the earlier Tantivy-led
> Search V3 migration plan. The live product now uses frankensearch-backed
> search; preserve the procedures below as historical design context rather
> than current operator guidance.

**Status:** Active
**Bead:** br-2tnl.8.3
**Supplemental Bead:** br-1x3h5
**Author:** MagentaMantis (claude-code/opus-4.5)
**Date:** 2026-02-12

## Overview

This runbook provides step-by-step procedures for migrating from SQLite FTS5 to Search V3
(Tantivy + optional semantic/hybrid). The migration is designed to be:

- **Safe:** Shadow validation before cutover
- **Reversible:** Kill switches and fallback paths
- **Observable:** Metrics at every stage

## Prerequisites

1. **Rust toolchain:** Nightly (see `rust-toolchain.toml`)
2. **Disk space:** ~50MB per 10k messages for Tantivy + vector indexes
3. **Environment:** All instances must have Search V3 crate enabled (check `Cargo.toml` features)

## Configuration Reference

| Variable | Values | Default | Description |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `AM_SEARCH_ENGINE` | `legacy`, `lexical`, `semantic`, `hybrid`, `auto` | `lexical` | Primary search engine |
| `AM_SEARCH_SHADOW_MODE` | `off`, `log_only`, `compare` | `off` | Shadow comparison mode |
| `AM_SEARCH_SEMANTIC_ENABLED` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Kill switch for semantic embeddings |
| `AM_SEARCH_RERANK_ENABLED` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Kill switch for reranking |
| `AM_SEARCH_FALLBACK_ON_ERROR` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Fall back to FTS5 on V3 errors |
| `AM_SEARCH_ENGINE_FOR_<TOOL>` | (same as above) | - | Per-tool engine override; read by `search_messages` and `search_messages_product` |

**Kill switch behavior:**
- `AM_SEARCH_SEMANTIC_ENABLED=false` + `AM_SEARCH_ENGINE=hybrid` → degrades to `lexical`.
  The switch also governs per-tool overrides and engines chosen per query
  (the TUI search mode), so `semantic`, `hybrid`, and `auto` all run
  `lexical` until it is `true`.
- `AM_SEARCH_RERANK_ENABLED=false` → skips reranking step, returns fusion scores

Build-mode boundary: runtime `hybrid` settings require a binary built with the
crate `feature = "hybrid"` path. Portable and no-default-feature builds keep the
lexical Search V3 path and deterministic SQL plan handling for empty or
non-searchable queries.

---

## Phase 1: Preparation (Day -7)

### 1.1 Verify Feature Flags

```bash
# Confirm search-core crate is included
cargo tree -p mcp-agent-mail-search-core

# Confirm tantivy feature is enabled
cargo tree -p mcp-agent-mail-search-core -f "{p} {f}"
```

Expected output includes `tantivy-engine` feature.

### 1.2 Build Initial Index

```bash
# Set environment (or use .env file)
export AM_SEARCH_ENGINE=legacy
export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///path/to/agent_mail.db
export STORAGE_ROOT=/path/to/.mcp_agent_mail

# Trigger full index build (runs in background)
# The index builds automatically on first startup with V3 enabled
cargo run -p mcp-agent-mail -- serve --port 8765 --no-tui &

# Monitor index build progress
tail -f logs/search_index.log | grep -E "(IndexLifecycle|rebuild|indexed)"
```

### 1.3 Validation Checkpoint 1: Index Built

```bash
# Check index directory exists
ls -la "${STORAGE_ROOT}/search_index/"

# Verify index health via health_check tool
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"health_check","arguments":{}}}' \
  | jq '.result.content[0].text | fromjson | .search_index_health'
```

Expected: `"status": "ready"` with document counts matching database.

---

## Phase 2: Shadow Validation (Days 0-14)

### 2.1 Enable Shadow Mode (Log Only)

```bash
# Shadow mode: run both engines, return legacy results, log comparison
export AM_SEARCH_ENGINE=legacy
export AM_SEARCH_SHADOW_MODE=log_only
```

Restart server. All search queries now run against both FTS5 and Tantivy.

### 2.2 Monitor Shadow Metrics

```bash
# View shadow comparison logs
grep "Search V3 shadow comparison" logs/server.log

# Key metrics to watch:
# - overlap_pct: percentage of top-10 results shared (target: >80%)
# - rank_correlation: Kendall tau (-1 to +1, target: >0.6)
# - latency_delta_ms: V3 vs legacy (target: <50ms slower, ideally faster)
# - v3_error_count: should be zero
```

### 2.3 Metrics Dashboard Queries

If using TUI (screen 7: Tool Metrics), shadow metrics appear under "search_messages".

For programmatic access:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"health_check","arguments":{}}}' \
  | jq '.result.content[0].text | fromjson | .shadow_metrics'
```

### 2.4 Validation Checkpoint 2: Shadow Metrics Pass

**Quality Gates (must all pass):**

| Metric | Threshold | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| `equivalent_pct` | ≥75% | Most queries should produce equivalent results |
| `v3_error_pct` | <1% | V3 path must be stable |
| `avg_overlap_pct` | ≥70% | Result sets should substantially overlap |
| `avg_latency_delta_ms` | <100 | V3 should not be dramatically slower |

If any threshold fails, investigate before proceeding:

```bash
# Find divergent queries
grep "divergent results" logs/server.log | head -20

# Check specific query behavior
grep "query_text.*<your-query>" logs/server.log
```

---

## Phase 3: Shadow Compare Mode (Days 14-21)

### 3.1 Switch to Compare Mode

```bash
# Shadow compare: run both, return V3 results, log divergence warnings
export AM_SEARCH_ENGINE=lexical
export AM_SEARCH_SHADOW_MODE=compare
```

Restart server. Users now receive V3 results, but FTS5 still runs for comparison.

### 3.2 Monitor for Regressions

Watch for user complaints or automated test failures:

```bash
# Check for divergence warnings (compare mode logs divergent results)
grep "divergent results" logs/server.log | wc -l

# Compare with baseline
# (Store baseline count at start of compare phase)
```

### 3.3 Validation Checkpoint 3: Compare Mode Stable

After 7 days in compare mode:

- No critical bug reports related to search
- `v3_error_pct` still <1%
- No sustained latency degradation

---

## Phase 4: Full Cutover (Day 21+)

### 4.1 Disable Shadow Mode

```bash
export AM_SEARCH_ENGINE=lexical   # or hybrid if semantic enabled
export AM_SEARCH_SHADOW_MODE=off
```

Restart server. Only V3 engine runs.

### 4.2 Enable Semantic/Hybrid (Optional)

If semantic embeddings are desired:

```bash
export AM_SEARCH_ENGINE=hybrid
export AM_SEARCH_SEMANTIC_ENABLED=true
# Optionally enable reranking for improved relevance
export AM_SEARCH_RERANK_ENABLED=true
```

**Note:** Semantic embeddings require building the vector index, which happens
automatically in the background. Monitor progress:

```bash
grep "VectorIndex" logs/server.log | tail -20
```

### 4.3 Validation Checkpoint 4: V3 Serving

```bash
# Confirm engine is V3
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"health_check","arguments":{}}}' \
  | jq '.result.content[0].text | fromjson | .search_engine_active'

# Expected: "lexical" or "hybrid" (not "legacy")
```

---

## Phase 5: FTS5 Decommission (Day 28+)

### 5.1 Remove FTS5 Triggers

Once confident in V3, remove synchronous FTS5 triggers to eliminate write overhead:

```sql
-- Run via sqlite3 or migration script
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS fts_messages_ai;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS fts_messages_au;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS fts_messages_ad;
```

**WARNING:** This is irreversible. Ensure Phase 4 validation is complete.

### 5.2 Vacuum FTS5 Table (Optional)

If disk space is a concern, vacuum the FTS5 table:

```sql
-- Optional: reclaim space from FTS5
INSERT INTO fts_messages(fts_messages) VALUES('optimize');
VACUUM;
```

### 5.3 Validation Checkpoint 5: Clean State

```bash
# Confirm no FTS5 triggers
sqlite3 /path/to/agent_mail.db ".schema" | grep -c "fts_messages"

# Expected: 0 triggers, only the virtual table definition remains
```

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback from Any Phase to Legacy

```bash
export AM_SEARCH_ENGINE=legacy
export AM_SEARCH_SHADOW_MODE=off
```

Restart server. FTS5 resumes immediately (no rebuild needed).

### Rollback After FTS5 Decommission

If triggers have been removed, FTS5 data may be stale. Options:

1. **Rebuild FTS5 index:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO fts_messages(fts_messages) VALUES('rebuild');
   ```

2. **Restore from backup:**
   Use the most recent database backup with intact FTS5 triggers.

---

## Per-Surface Override Examples

Override engine for specific tools while testing:

```bash
# Hybrid for the two search tools, lexical everywhere else
export AM_SEARCH_ENGINE=lexical
export AM_SEARCH_SEMANTIC_ENABLED=true   # without it the overrides run lexical
export AM_SEARCH_ENGINE_FOR_SEARCH_MESSAGES=hybrid
export AM_SEARCH_ENGINE_FOR_SEARCH_MESSAGES_PRODUCT=hybrid
```

Overrides are read from the process environment of the server, not from
`config.env`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Index Build Fails

```bash
# Check for corrupted index
rm -rf "${STORAGE_ROOT}/search_index/"

# Restart server to trigger rebuild
```

### V3 Returns Empty Results

1. Check index health: `health_check` tool
2. Verify schema hash: `${STORAGE_ROOT}/search_index/schema_hash.json`
3. Check query syntax: V3 is stricter about wildcard placement

### High Latency in Hybrid Mode

Semantic embedding generation can be slow without GPU:

```bash
# Disable semantic temporarily
export AM_SEARCH_SEMANTIC_ENABLED=false
```

There is no environment knob for the embedding batch size.

### Shadow Metrics Show High Divergence

This is expected for:
- Queries using semantic synonyms (V3 finds more)
- Queries with typos (V3 handles better with fuzzy matching)

Investigate specific queries before deciding if divergence is acceptable.

---

## Steady-State Operations (Post-Cutover)

This section is the operational contract for `br-2tnl.8.5` (steady-state operations +
verification). It assumes Search V3 is the active serving engine and focuses on
repeatable verification, incident handling, and evidence capture.

### Operational Guardrails (Source of Truth)

Use `docs/SPEC-search-v3-quality-gates.md` as the canonical threshold source.
The minimum steady-state guardrails to enforce operationally:

| Signal | Target / Threshold | Response if Breached |
|--------|--------------------|----------------------|
| `v3_error_rate` | `< 1%` rolling 15m | Trigger Incident Matrix + open P0 bead |
| `search_index_health` | `ready` | Run Procedure A (lexical rebuild) |
| Hybrid p95 latency drift | `< 20%` vs prior weekly baseline | Run load suite + profile/tune semantic path |
| Relevance drift (weekly) | No sustained regression vs prior artifact set | Open follow-up bead with evidence bundle |
| Queue pressure (`wbq`, `commit_coalescer`) | No sustained warning state | Investigate storage/DB pressure before user impact |

### Daily Verification (Operator Checklist)

1. Confirm serving engine + index health:
   ```bash
   curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/ \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"health_check","arguments":{}}}' \
     | jq '.result.content[0].text | fromjson | {search_engine_active,search_index_health,pool_utilization,queues}'
   ```
2. Run a smoke query against production-like scope:
   ```bash
   AM_INTERFACE_MODE=cli mcp-agent-mail mail search \
     --project /abs/path/to/project \
     --limit 10 \
     "coordination" \
     --json | jq 'length'
   ```
3. Verify no sustained queue pressure (`queues.wbq.warning=false`, `queues.commit_coalescer.warning=false`).
4. Record output snapshots in an ops evidence folder (date-stamped) and link them in the active rollout/bead thread.

### Weekly Verification (Quality + Performance)

1. Execute quick CI gates and archive report:
   ```bash
   am ci --quick --json --report tests/artifacts/ci/search_v3_weekly.json
   ```
2. Run the native Search V3 weekly bundle runner:
   ```bash
   scripts/e2e_search_v3_weekly_bundle.sh --strict-freshness
   ```
   This executes:
   - `tests/e2e/test_search_v3_stdio.sh`
   - `tests/e2e/test_search_v3_http.sh`
   - `tests/e2e/test_search_v3_resilience.sh`
   - `tests/e2e/test_search_v3_load_concurrency.sh`
3. Inspect machine-readable rollup output:
   - `tests/artifacts/search_v3_weekly/<timestamp>/rollup.json`
   - `tests/artifacts/search_v3_weekly/<timestamp>/rollup.txt`
4. Validate artifact bundle integrity:
   ```bash
   source scripts/e2e_lib.sh
   e2e_validate_bundle_tree tests/artifacts
   ```
5. Compare this week’s latency/relevance artifacts against prior weekly baseline artifacts; open a follow-up bead if any guardrail regresses.

CI schedule:
- GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/search-v3-weekly.yml`
- Trigger: weekly cron + `workflow_dispatch`
- Artifacts: `search-v3-weekly-artifacts`

### Post-Cutover Verification Windows

Run this schedule after enabling full Search V3 serving:

1. **T+24h**: `stdio` + `http` + `resilience` suites must pass with complete artifacts.
2. **T+7d**: repeat weekly bundle and confirm no sustained error/latency drift.
3. **T+30d**: verify no recurring legacy fallback incidents and confirm operations remain within guardrails.

### Incident Triage Matrix

| Symptom | Immediate Action | Next Step |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Empty or near-empty results | Check `search_index_health` + last rebuild timestamp | Rebuild lexical index (Procedure A) |
| Latency spike in hybrid mode | Set `AM_SEARCH_SEMANTIC_ENABLED=false` temporarily | Profile embedding/vector path; tune batch/backpressure |
| Rising divergence in compare/shadow logs | Capture top divergent queries from server log | Run focused replay/parity script; decide rollback/cutover hold |
| V3 error rate >1% | Set `AM_SEARCH_ENGINE=legacy` if user impact is high | Open P0 bug bead with failing queries + artifacts |

### Repair Procedures

#### Procedure A: Lexical Index Rebuild

```bash
# 1) Stop server
# 2) Backup and remove corrupted lexical index
mv "${STORAGE_ROOT}/search_index" "${STORAGE_ROOT}/search_index.corrupt.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"

# 3) Restart server to trigger rebuild
mcp-agent-mail serve --no-tui
```

Post-check: `health_check` must report Search V3 index status `ready` and non-zero docs.

#### Procedure B: Semantic/Vector Cache Repair

```bash
# Temporarily force lexical-only service while repairing semantic assets
export AM_SEARCH_ENGINE=lexical
export AM_SEARCH_SEMANTIC_ENABLED=false
mcp-agent-mail serve --no-tui
```

Then clear/rebuild vector artifacts per deployment layout and re-enable semantic mode only after
latency and overlap checks return to thresholds.

### Follow-Up Bead Triggers

Create a new bead immediately when any of the following is observed:

- `v3_error_pct >= 1%` for more than 15 minutes
- `avg_latency_delta_ms >= 100` sustained across weekly verification
- `equivalent_pct < 75%` or measurable relevance regression on weekly replay/verification checks
- Any cross-project scope or redaction regression in search output

When creating the bead, attach:
- failing query samples,
- health snapshot JSON,
- relevant server log window,
- command transcript used for reproduction,
- artifact paths under `tests/artifacts/search_v3_*`.

### Structured Diagnostics Contract (Required Evidence)

Every weekly verification run and incident-triggered follow-up must include these
machine-readable artifacts so another operator can replay without prior context:

| Evidence Field | Required Location / Source |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Scenario IDs + pass/fail status | `${SEARCH_V3_RUN_DIR}/summaries/suite_summary.json` (`cases[].case_id`, `status`) |
| Timing breakdowns (latency/elapsed) | `${SEARCH_V3_RUN_DIR}/summaries/suite_summary.json` + `tests/artifacts/search_v3_*/<timestamp>/metrics.json` |
| Error/reason codes and failing assertions | `${SEARCH_V3_RUN_DIR}/logs/summary.log` and suite `diagnostics/*.txt` files |
| Artifact directory + bundle manifest | `tests/artifacts/search_v3_*/<timestamp>/bundle.json` |
| Reproduction command + environment | `tests/artifacts/search_v3_*/<timestamp>/repro.txt` and `repro.env` |
| Evidence freshness status (stale/missing paths + remediation) | `tests/artifacts/search_v3_freshness/latest.json` from `scripts/search_v3_evidence_freshness_check.sh` |

If any field is missing, treat the run as non-actionable and re-run the suite before
closing the incident or marking a verification window complete.

### Evidence Freshness SLOs and Escalation

`scripts/search_v3_evidence_freshness_check.sh` enforces freshness expectations for required
Search V3 evidence files (`suite_summary.json`, `metrics.json`, `bundle.json`, `repro.txt`,
`repro.env`) across the latest run in each `tests/artifacts/search_v3_*` suite root.

| SLO Category | Suites / Artifact Roots | Max Age |
|--------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Daily snapshots | `search_v3_stdio`, `search_v3_http`, `search_v3_resilience` | 24h (`86400s`) |
| Weekly suite bundle | `search_v3_load_concurrency` | 7d (`604800s`) |
| Post-cutover checkpoints | `search_v3_shadow_parity` | 30d (`2592000s`) |

Run checker (strict mode fails CI/automation when stale or missing evidence is detected):

```bash
scripts/search_v3_evidence_freshness_check.sh --strict \
  --output tests/artifacts/search_v3_freshness/latest.json
```

Escalation policy when checker reports `alert`:
1. Re-run the remediation command listed for each stale/missing suite.
2. If the rerun still reports missing/stale evidence, page the Search V3 owner/on-call and open a bead with the failing paths and ages from `latest.json`.
3. Do not mark weekly verification or incident follow-up as complete until the checker returns `summary.status = "pass"`.

### Residual Risks and Follow-Up Beads

- `br-2tnl.8.7` (P2) closed: weekly Search V3 bundle automation now runs via `scripts/e2e_search_v3_weekly_bundle.sh` and scheduled CI (`.github/workflows/search-v3-weekly.yml`).
- `br-2tnl.8.8` (P2) closed: stale-artifact detection and evidence freshness alerts enforced via `scripts/search_v3_evidence_freshness_check.sh`.

### Sign-Off

Search V3 rollout objectives are met with no critical regressions identified in current evidence.  
Remaining risks are now execution hygiene (running the weekly workflow reliably and triaging freshness alerts quickly), not architecture or parity gaps.
