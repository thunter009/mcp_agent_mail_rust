# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep MCP Agent Mail safe. This file explains how to report a
vulnerability and summarizes the project's security posture and hardening knobs.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please report security issues privately — do not open a public issue for an
unpatched vulnerability.**

- Preferred: use GitHub's **[Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail_rust/security/advisories/new)**
  ("Report a vulnerability" under the repository's *Security* tab). This opens a
  confidential advisory thread between you and the maintainer.
- Alternative: email the maintainer (see the GitHub profile for
  [@Dicklesworthstone](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone)) with `SECURITY
  [mcp_agent_mail_rust]` in the subject.

When reporting, include where possible: affected version/commit, the deployment
shape (loopback-only vs exposed, auth configured or not), a `file:line`
reference or minimal reproduction, and the impact you believe it has. Static
review notes are welcome too — see [#149](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail_rust/issues/149)
for the kind of report that is genuinely useful.

There is no formal SLA (this is a solo-maintained project), but credible reports
are taken seriously and acknowledged as bandwidth allows. Please give a
reasonable window to ship a fix before public disclosure.

## Supported versions

Only the latest released version on `main` is supported. Fixes ship forward in a
new release rather than being backported.

## Threat model (read this first)

The **default and documented deployment model is a single-user or tightly
trusted local operator**: the HTTP server binds to loopback (`127.0.0.1`) and
coordinates the operator's own agents on the same machine. Identity and project
scoping are **advisory by design** in that model — a self-asserted `agent_name`
and a client-chosen `project_key` are conveniences for cooperating local agents,
not a tenancy boundary between mutually untrusted parties.

The full, living threat model — assets, adversaries, attack surfaces, and
mitigations — lives in [`docs/SPEC-threat-model.md`](docs/SPEC-threat-model.md).

## Security posture

- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` across all workspace crates — no `unsafe` in
  production code.
- Fully parameterized SQL (`?` binds) throughout the DB crate; no string-built
  query values.
- Git is invoked via libgit2 / argv arrays, never a shell — no command
  injection via message subjects, bodies, or branch names.
- Path inputs are slugified and component-validated against traversal
  (`..`, absolute paths, `.git`) and symlink escape from `STORAGE_ROOT`.
- Markdown → HTML is sanitized with `ammonia` (tag/scheme/attribute allowlists);
  templates use autoescaping.
- HTTP handlers run under a panic firewall (`catch_unwind` + admission control)
  so a malformed request cannot crash the daemon.
- Mutating web-UI (`/mail/`) routes are CSRF-guarded (require
  `Content-Type: application/json` and a same-origin/allowlisted
  `Origin`/`Referer`).
- Baseline security response headers (`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
  `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`) ride on every
  response.
- Bearer-token comparison is constant-time.
- `cargo audit` + `cargo deny` run weekly in CI
  ([`.github/workflows/supply-chain-audit.yml`](.github/workflows/supply-chain-audit.yml)),
  and release verification in the installers is mandatory by default
  (bypassable only with an explicit `--no-verify`).

## Release trust model

- **Releases v0.3.31 and later** are built and published by the maintainer's
  own release infrastructure, not GitHub Actions. Each release ships a
  `SHA256SUMS` manifest and a detached **minisign** signature
  (`SHA256SUMS.minisig`) made with the maintainer-held release key
  (id `1BBD79B28BF718D0`; the public key is pinned inside `install.sh` and
  `install.ps1`). The installers verify the signature over the exact manifest
  bytes, then verify each archive's SHA-256 against the authenticated
  manifest, before extraction. A missing `minisign` binary, manifest,
  signature, or checksum entry aborts the install.
- **`am self-update` enforces the same model** with a built-in pure-Rust
  minisign verifier (no `minisign` executable needed): it downloads
  `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.minisig`, verifies the signature over the exact
  manifest bytes against the release keys embedded in the binary, and only
  then trusts the archive digest. The signature's key id selects the trusted
  key, so rotating the release key means shipping a release that trusts both
  keys before signing with the new one. An unsigned, tampered, or
  unknown-key manifest aborts the update before any binary is replaced; the
  updater cannot install pre-v0.3.31 releases (use the installer for those).
- **Releases before v0.3.31** were built by GitHub Actions and are verified
  with the original Sigstore/cosign keyless path: a per-archive
  `.sigstore.json` bundle validated against the literal
  `dist.yml@refs/tags/<tag>` workflow identity and the GitHub Actions OIDC
  issuer. The installers keep this path intact for installing old versions.
- **Why the change**: releases are no longer produced by GitHub Actions, so
  no new release can carry a certificate for the Actions workflow identity —
  the old requirement had become unsatisfiable (v0.3.30 shipped without
  bundles and the installer failed closed everywhere). The trust anchor moved
  from "GitHub's CI identity for this repository" to "a signing key the
  maintainer controls", the same model used across the maintainer's other
  released tools. Verification remains fail-closed in both models.

## Hardening for deployments beyond loopback

The frictionless local defaults (no token, permissive dev-mode CORS, rate
limiting off) are deliberate for the trusted-local case. **Before exposing the
server beyond loopback or sharing one instance among less-trusted agents**, you
should:

- Set `HTTP_BEARER_TOKEN` (or enable JWT) — auth is off by default. The server
  logs a loud warning when bound to a non-loopback host with no auth configured.
- Set `APP_ENVIRONMENT=production` to disable development-mode CORS reflection.
- Enable rate limiting (`HTTP_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true`).
- Front the deployment with a vetted reverse proxy terminating TLS and, ideally,
  enforcing auth/rate limits and a strict `Content-Security-Policy`.
- Treat the SQLite DB, Git archive, and env files as plaintext at rest —
  confidentiality relies on OS account and filesystem permissions.

See the [Configuration](README.md#configuration) and
[Limitations](README.md#limitations) sections of the README for the full set of
knobs.
